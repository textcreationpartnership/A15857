            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Very great ſurely is the light of the trueth in this our age, which through Gods ſingular gift, hath bin found out in the holy ſcriptures, by ſome faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt, and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad farre and wide hath ſhined forth vnto vs, as the ſunne in the firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but I pray what and how many miſtes of errors, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and black clouds of hereſies, haue bin ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp and raked out of the depth of hell, by no

            <p>I ſpeake not nowe of tyrants: which euer haue, and yet doe imploye and bend all their ſwords, all their power, and the very force and might of their authoritie to this: that theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delſticks (of brittle earth I confeſſe) wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this light remaineth &amp; ſhineth being bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; broken by their iron-blowes; the whole light of the diuine wiſedome (if god ſo pleaſed) might be vtterly put out &amp; extinguiſhed: &amp; in place therof, that infernal darknes fetcht againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hel, might ſucceed &amp; beare the whole ſway.</p>
            <p>For this very cauſe, what in theſe our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched times hath bin done: what and what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſlaughters of an infinite number of men, in many places committed, and in many other places attempted more then once: wee haue yet in freſh memory. And what, and by whome, the deuil lately aſſaied in thoſe valleies of yours. though by Gods mightie hand defending you, the ſlaughter ſucceeded not to the wiſh of thoſe vngodly wretches: your ſelf know better, then we do. And now alſo what that euer-buſie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, is for the ſame intent continually attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: what deuiſes he purpoſeth: what treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he ſtudies: what weapons hee prepareth:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21305:3"/>what warres he brocheth againſt godly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and magiſtrats, who deſire to haue this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie light to ſhine in their dominions, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſpreade the ſame farre and wide into the whole world, the Lord himſelfe knoweth, who dwelleth in the heauens, who alſo is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſcatter the wicked counſailes of the vngodly &amp; to diſperſe them as vaine ſmoakes, through his incredible loue and mercie towardes vs, when it is moſt expedient for his church, and when tyrants do looke for nothing leſſe, then a diſapointement of their intents, which they ſo long and watchfully prouided for.</p>
            <p>For witneſſes take the Pharaohs: Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribs: Amans: Antiochies: Iulians: and other ſuch like enemies to the church. For ſtill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe abideth, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it.</hi> But to let paſſe tyrants, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the bodie of our chriſtian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſo miſerably torne in pecces: who is there, I pray you, except he be cleane voide of alpietie, that beholding ſuch and ſo great a rent of this bodie into diuers ſhiuers, namely of all thoſe which profeſſe and call vppon Chriſt as true God and true man, &amp; the onely redeemer of the world diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defending diuers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors moſt obſtinatly: ſome, many &amp; thoſe moſt groſſe: others, fewe and thoſe not ſo waighty:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21305:4"/>and vpon theſe occaſions purſuing and hating on another with more then ſerpentine hatred: and plaging and tormenting on another with more then butcherly crueltie: what man is he, I ſay, who beholding theſe things, hearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and waighing them in his minde, is not moued with great griefe, ſigheth not, lamenteth nor, poureth not forth teares? The church of Rome once in times of old, was for the great glory of her pietie, her heauenly doctrine, her diuine ſeruice, chriſtian diſcipline, and conſtancie in the faith againſt all hereticks, moſt famous: and as the ſunne in the firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhineth farr brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all ſtarres, ſo ſhe ſhined farre aboue all churches on earth, by example of her excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding chriſtian pietie: that well and fittly ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to bee generally called the mother of all churches. But into what and into how great darkeneſſe and blindneſſe did ſhe after ſinke, by Gods iuſt iudgement, being as it were caſt out of heauen, and in the ſame ſtill lieth buried and drowned? he that in ſuch great light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſeeth not this, is blinder then a moule. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any new thing: ſeing the ſame happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firſt to the church of the Iſraelites: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the churches in the Eaſt, and to them in Greece.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeake of thoſe churches, which in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21305:4"/>ſuch thinges as the Romiſh church hath made an apoſtaſie or backſliding from the Apoſtles, haue beene forced through her willfulnes and tirannie, at length to forſake her: what horrible hereſies in ſome of them, haue bin fetched out of hel by the miniſters of Sathan? Anabaptiſme, Libertiniſme, Arianiſme, Samoſateniſme, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſme, Eutychianiſme, Neſtorianiſme, and what not? yea euen Atheiſme [I grieue to ſpeak it] ſpreadeth it ſelfe aboundantly. The truſtie miniſters of Chriſt haue withſtood all theſe, &amp; in many places haue beaten downe their diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh doctrines, and haue preſerued their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, reformed by the ſincere doctrine of the goſpell, free from theſe peſtilent miſchiefes, and by Gods benefite, do ſtill preſerue them: ſo that we haue no friendſhipp nor dealing with ſuch manner offects: and yet notwithſtanding this cockle cannot bee cleane weeded out in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Many plagues do ſtill grow and increaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where: and many wicked ſpirites doe ſtill come into the worlde. VVhat then ſhould a chriſtian man, who loueth the glory of God, &amp; the ſaluation of his owne ſoule &amp; his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and deſireth to haue a good name in the church [for it is a matter of no ſmale moment, to bee taken and accompted in the catholicke church, for a true member of Chriſt:] what I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21305:5"/>ſay, ſhould a chriſtian man do, in ſuch a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things, ſuch a diſſagreement in opinions, ſuch a multitude of hereſies, ſuch varietie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions? I wil, if I can, by a ſimilitude declare my opinion, agreeable to the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>If a huge &amp; a moſt mightie armie of enemies ſhould ouercome any cuntrey, killing &amp; ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereſoeuer they came, ſo as they could not quickly or eaſily be driuen out againe: what ſhould the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of that cuntrey do, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the ſafety of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>

Therefore there muſt great care be taken, that diligent inquirie bee made, who be in the citie: what they doe: what life they lead: &amp; wheron they liue: and if there be any founde to goe out of courſe from the common profesſion, life, &amp; manners of the cittie: they may be knowne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, corrected, puniſhed, or driuen out of the cittie. But as there is nothing that can either ſet a deeper marke of infamie vppon the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, or make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerue to be more ſeuerelie puniſhed, then if being entiſed by large promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or bribes of the enemies, they betraye their cuntrey: or being terrified by their threatnings, they ſlipp from their ruler, &amp; ſhamefully yeeld themſelues: ſo contrarywiſe, there is nothing more honorable, more profitable, or worthie of greater praiſe and reward, then if keeping ſound thy faith to thy prince and cuntrey, with the publike profeſſion of the faith thereof, thou conſtantly ſtandeſt to it euen vnto death, and fighteſt it out to the laſt man.

            <p>About the points of the ſacraments alſo, if a man will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent himſelfe with the ſimple truth: what is more euident then the doctrine which the auncient fathers, Iuſtine, Ireneus, Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Cyprian, and chieflie Auguſtine haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the ſcriptures and left vnto vs in their writings? One ſaith: <hi>Like as Ieſus Chriſt being by the word of God, made fleſh, had fleſh and blood: ſo alſo we haue learned that the foode hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by him, by the word of prayer and thanks giuing, is the fleſh and blood of the ſame incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> (euen according to thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my bodie:</hi>) But Chriſt, that is, <hi>the vvorde</hi> was made fleſh without anie chaunging of it ſelfe into fleſh, but onely by a hypoſtaticall or perſonall vnion: therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the bread made the body of Chriſt, by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21305:8"/>any tranſubſtantiation of it ſelfe into the body, but onely by an vnion, and that not a phyſicall or bodily, or hypoſtaticall, but onely a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vnion: Alſo he ſaith, by that foode, namely of the bleſſed bread, our blood and our body is nouriſhed, by a certaine chaunging (of it ſelfe namely into Chriſt:) therefore that chaunge which is made in the ſupper, is not, of the bread into Chriſts body: nor of Chriſt into vs, but of vs into Chriſt, by reaſon of our ingrafting: as alſo wee reade in Auguſtine, that Chriſt ſhould ſay, ſpeaking of the receiuing of the Euchariſt, <hi>I ſhal not be chaunged into thee, but thou ſhalt be chaunged into me.</hi> The ſame man ſaith: vnto this (the foode of the Euchariſt) none is to bee admitted, but they that beleeue that our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true, being waſhed with the water of regeneration vnto remisſion of their ſinnes, &amp; ſo liuing, as Chriſt hath taught them. Therfore no infidells and heretikes: nor they which haue not receiued the baptiſme of Chriſt: not they which liue in ſuch apparent ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that they giue no notice to the church of their amendment: are to bee admitted to the ſupper.</p>
            <p>Another of them ſaieth, <hi>the euchariſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of two matters: an earthly and an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> The bread, though it be ſanctified, yet he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21305:9"/>it an earthly matter: why ſo? becauſe it comes from the earth, it exiſteth on earth, and is eaten with an earthly mouth: the body of Chriſt he calleth a heauenly matter, not becauſe the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it is out of heauen, but partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is taken into vnitie of the perſon of <hi>the word,</hi> and partly becauſe it is in heauen endued with heauenly qualities. For although in the <hi>hypoſtaſie,</hi> which is the very word, it bee euerie where: yet in the owne proper eſſence, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heauen, and not on earth. Whereupon it alſo followeth, that it is not eaten, either by earthly men, or by the teeth of an earthly body: but onely of thoſe men, who being borne from aboue, do carrie the image of heauenly men &amp; eate it in a heauenly manner, namely in ſoule &amp; ſpirite. And yet notwithſtanding the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo of the faithful, while they eate onely an earthly matter, they alſo participate of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie matter, to their glorious reſurrection, &amp; are nouriſhed by it: as the ſame author in that place very learnedly expoundeth.</p>
            <p>I think that by this which I haue ſpoken out of the creede concerning foure principal partes of chriſtian doctrine, your Hon. can well ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, [ſuch is your piety, learning &amp; wiſedome) what is to be concluded concerning the whole body. The ſumme is this: that thoſe bee the true
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21305:9"/>churches of Chriſt, and therefore called of vs the truely defenſed citties of Chriſts kingdom, which profesſing generally the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſpecially the catechiſme in all places receiued: doe ſo reuerence the auncient church and auncient fathers, hauing therefore friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp and communion with them being now in heauen; that neither in their opinions, nor yet in their expoſitions of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they will eaſily decline from them: but onely then, whenas they bee forced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, both by manifeſt wordes of the holy ſcriptures, and alſo by teſtimonies, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences beyond all doubt neceſſary, drawne from the principles of faith. This ſurely was counted for a notorious fault in Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and it is written to bee the cauſe of his vile hereſie: that contemning the fathers, and truſting vpon his owne witt, he expounded the holy ſcriptures after his owne braine. What ſpeake I of Neſtorius? yea that the ſame contempt of the fathers, and ſome confidence of their owne witts, and their owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, did cauſe diuers more beſides, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies verie notable men, to fall into ſundrie hereſies: I could eaſilie ſhewe out of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall hiſtories and councells, if the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of an epiſtle would ſuffer me. For whence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21305:10"/>I pray was it, that after that moſt holy councell at Nice, ſo many heretikes forth with aroſe: of whome ſome oppugned the true and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting deity of Chriſt: others his true and perfect humanitie: others the true vniting of both the natures in one and the ſame perſon: others the true diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their natures &amp; their proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? hence ſurely, that conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the fathers in the Nicene councell, and their expoſitions vpon the holy ſcriptures: and truſting confidently to their owne witts, and puffed vp with humane knowledge and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, they dared euery one to expound, yea indeed, to depraue &amp; wreſt the holy ſcriptures, and foundations of the faith, according to their owne fanſies. Hereunto pertaineth that which Vigilius left written in his firſt booke <hi>of the cauſes of hereſies</hi> againſt Eutyches: but they blow forth [ſaieth he] theſe ſmoakes of vaine accuſations chieflie: becauſe they are euen ſicke of the infirmity of ignorance or diſeaſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: and whilſt they are gogged on with a fond conceite of minde, they deſpiſe the rules of faith deliuered of old by the fathers, onely for this cauſe, to bring in their owne conceited opinions of innouations into the church. Thus ſaith Vigilius. This that I ſay, is confirmed by the diſpoſitions, imitations, and wordes of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21305:10"/>ſound fathers on the other ſide, who expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſcriptures and the foundations of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith according to the determinations of the fathers of elder times, haue euer no leſſe proſperouſly then faithfully defended the truth of chriſtian religion, and preſerued the ſame ſoundly confirmed in the church. To which purpoſe tend the wordes which they vſe in their owne determinations: <hi>We therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvhere following the determinations of the old fathers, and their rule: doe alſo determine the ſame, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing then is more ſafe, then that euery man keepe himſelfe within theſe churches, as in citties well fenſed: wherein the holy ſcriptures are expounded, according to the analogie or rules of faith, and according to the receiued expoſitions of the auncient fathers: and conſequently, which hold the ſame faith, that the Apoſtles did, and all the auncient church.</p>
            <p>I haue ſpoken of the firſt duety of a chriſtian man, which deſireth to keep himſelfe and his family ſafe from his enemies, vnto euerlaſting life: namely, that he muſt retire himſelfe into the defenſed citties of Chriſts kingdome, and there conſtantly abide: vntill that at the laſt all enemies, being put to flight, by the glorious comming of our king, we may be ſafe and free
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21305:11"/>in all places.</p>
            <p>But without prouiſion of vitalls, who can long maintaine his life: our victual or ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is the daily hearing, reading and meditation of Gods word, and the receiuing of the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at appointed times: For by both theſe wee are nouriſhed, ſtreng thened and we liue: &amp; that through Chriſt our life, whome they offer and giue vnto vs. He which eateth this bread (take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either by the word, or by the ſacraments) ſhall neuer die. In the Acts: Chriſts diſciples conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in breaking of bread, that is, in their common loue-feaſtes, in which the Lords ſupper vſed to be celebrated. And ſuch heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly victuals are ſeeldome wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting in well defenſed citties: yet except thou eateſt and drinkeſt, and by that meanes preſerueſt thy life, what good will it do thee to be in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cittie? Thou muſt therefore frequent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and receiue the ſacraments, and imploye thy ſelfe in reading the holy ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is very needefull alſo, that continuall praiers, both publike and priuate bee made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, wherein we muſt aske thoſe things, which the Lord Ieſus hath commanded to be asked of his father, namely al things, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aſwell to his glorie, as to our owne and our neighbors ſaluation: and that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21305:11"/>vs from all kinds of enemies, and keep vs ſafe in the trueth. <hi>In the day of tribulation ſhalt thou call vpon me,</hi> ſaieth the Lord. And is not then chiefly the day of affliction, when hereſies do ouerſpread and tyrants perſecute the truth? Then therefore chiefly is God to bee called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and that by faith. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paule ſaieth, <hi>Pray ye vvithout ceaſing:</hi> and Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>yee muſt praye alvvaies, and not bee vvearie.</hi> And he that thus prayeth, and prayeth by faith, howe ſhould he not obtaine? wherefore God addeth by his Prophet, <hi>And I vvill he are thee. Aske and yee ſhall receiue,</hi> ſaid alſo the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>ſeeke and yee ſhall finde: knocke and it ſhall bee opened vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 But how can it be, that men ſhould there liue happily, and the cittie be preſerued: where the cittizens among themſelues keep no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? therefore brotherly loue, peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord muſt bee kept: then which, nothing is ſweeter, nothing more pleaſing to God, and nothing can be more profitable for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church: as contrariewiſe there is no thing, by which, churches and all ſocieties are ſooner brought to ruine: then enuie, then hatred, then grudgings, then enmities, then diſſentions, then domeſticall fallinges out:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21305:12"/>Doubtleſſe there is no faith, where charity hath not place: ſith <hi>true faith</hi> as the Apoſtle witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>worketh by charitie.</hi> And brotherly loue hath euer bin a marke of true chriſtians: Chriſt himſelfe ſaying: <hi>By this ſhall men know that yee are my diſciples, if yee haue loue one vvith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This do the Acts of the Apoſtles teach vs, where Luke ſaith of the faithfull: <hi>they had one minde and one heart,</hi> namely in the Lord. And Tertullian reporteth in Apolog. cap. 39. that the Romanes were wont to ſay of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>marke hovv they loue one another.</hi> For by this brotherly loue, as by the true badge of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, they would haue chriſtians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from them that were no chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Further more how neceſſary the care of health is to all the cittizens liuing in ſuch a citty, to defend them and theirs, and ſo the whole cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt the enemies: was ſaid a little before. By this ſpirituall health, I meane a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: which as it ſpringeth from faith, ſo alſo it preſerueth faith, that it cannot quite decay: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the life of the body bringeth forth health: and health preſerueth the body in life. Euerie one therefore muſt be carefull, that he keepe a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. But by what meanes is it kept? 1. after a due ſorrow, by a ſure truſt, of the free forgiuenes of our ſinnes which we haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21305:12"/>through Chriſt: Next, by a true amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life: that is, an earneſt ſtudie of auoiding ſinnes afterward, and keeping the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of god laſtly by a firme purpoſe, if by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie we do fal, to riſe againe, and to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt for pardon. By this meanes ſhall wee alwaies hold faſt a good conſcience. He that in this ſort conſtantly looketh vnto his health: let him aſſuredly know, that the Lord will neuer ſuffer him, that he ſhall die at all: that is, that hee ſhall euer erre and goe aſtray vnto his laſt ende, in that doctrine which is neceſſary to his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Apoſtle ſaith to Timothie: <hi>keepe faith and a good conſcience, which while ſome haue caſt aſide, they haue made ſhipwrack concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith,</hi> that is, the doctrine of faith. They therefore which keepe faſt a good conſcience, ſhall neuer make a deadly ſhipwrack of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine neceſſary to ſaluation: Seing God by his grace, indueth them, as with the treaſure of a good conſcience, ſo alſo with a perſeuerance in the faith and with a heauenly gift of doctrine. The ſafeſt thing therefore, both at all times, and eſpecially in this diuerſitie of religions, is, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the churches, where the pure word of God is preached, and the aſſured foundations of the faith according to the expoſitions of the fathers, are retained, to imploye our ſelues in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21305:13"/>hearing the word of God, and receiuing the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: to call vpon God: to haue friendſhip with our brethren, and to keep a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our ſelues.</p>
            <p n="6">6 But vnto all theſe things, how neceſſarie watchfulneſſe is, who, vnleſſe he bee vtterly vnskilfull in all things, knowes not? where there is nothing at all to be feared, as in heauen: there is alſo no need of watchfulneſſe: but they may and they ought to liue in great ſecuritie. But where there want no theeues, robbers, intrappers, flatterers, couſeners, traytors, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and where all things are full of treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there, howe pernicious and daungerous, ſecuritie and retchleſneſſe is, who is he, that knoweth not? Therefore Chriſt Ieſus foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the euills which were at hand, ſaide to the Apoſtles, <hi>vvatch yee and pray, leaſt yee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into temptation.</hi> And Peter, <hi>Be ſober and vvatch: becauſe your aduer ſarie the deuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about, ſeeking vvhome he may deuoure.</hi> But what manner of watchfulnes is this, which the holie ghoſt requireth? what it is to watch in all liuing creatures, euerie man doth know. Therefore a man, in that he is indued with a minde, is ſaide then to watch: when putting from him all retchleſneſſe or careleſneſſe of minde, and with open eyes, he looketh atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21305:13"/>on the things ſet before him: and wiſelie diſcerneth what be good, and what be euill, what be profitable, and what be hurtfull: that ſo his will, may reiect that which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, and chooſe that which is to bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: may eſchew and driue away that which is to bee eſchewed, and allowe and ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that which is to bee allowed. VVherefore ſhaking of the drowſineſſe of all carnall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, we muſt watch: and wee muſt warilie take heede to our ſelues, and beware of the ſubtelties of the deuill, the inticements of the world and the fleſh, and of doctrines and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes of heretikes. <hi>Take heede vnto your ſelues of falſe prophets,</hi> ſaith our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>vvhich come vnto you in ſheepes cloathing, but invvardly are rauening wolues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7 Now how can any man watch, that is loaden with ſurfetting and dronkennes? therefore ſobrietie is verie needfull. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Apoſtle Peter firſt ſaid, <hi>Be yee ſober,</hi> and after addeth, <hi>and vvatch:</hi> and Paule: <hi>let vs bee ſober and vvatch.</hi> Sobrietie is cleane op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to dronkenneſſe: and <hi>ſobrietas</hi> ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie is ſaide as it were <hi>ſine ebrietate</hi> without dronkenneſſe. By which word, is ſignified
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21305:14"/>by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> the very ſurfett or ſickiſhnes of the ſtomack. For ſobrietie is the moderate vſe, not onely of drinke, but alſo of meate: that we ſhould be contented with ſuch &amp; ſo much, as ſufficeth for ſuſtaining of nature, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of health. Wherefore the Lord Ieſus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them vnto ſobrietie, dehorted them aſwell from ſurfeting as from dronkenes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ouercharge not your hearts with ſurfetting and dronkenes:</hi> euidently ſhewing in one word, howe pernicious and noyſome a thing dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes is. For by it mens hearts are ſo ouerloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and preſſed downe towards the ground: that they can neuer bee lifted vp, to call vppon God ſincerely, to an earneſt contemplation of heauenly matters, to an attentiue reading, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; true knowledge of the holy ſcriptures, laſtly, to a profitable conſideration of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, ſuch as is the Lords ſupper: and they which are giuen ouer to this vice of dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, are moſt vnapt for all exerciſes of piety. And howe many are there, which euen for their bellies lake, doe fall from the trueth? So farre from them is it, either that they can or will watch againſt the enemies thereof, or take heede to themſelues becauſe of falſe prophets: that thus at length they muſt needes miſerably periſh. But farre larger and wider doth this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21305:14"/>chriſtian ſobrietie extend it ſelfe, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: <hi>Let vs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be ſober and watch:</hi> that is, in the moderate vſe, not onely of meates and drinkes, but alſo of all other things in this world. For God would not haue vs to be, as it were by ſweet wines, dronken with the too much loue of riches, pleaſures, honours, friendes, children, wiues, nay not of our owne liues: but they which haue wiues, to be, as not hauing wiues: they which weep, as not wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: and they which reioyce, as though they reioyced not: and they which buy, as though they poſſeſſed not: and they which vſe this world, as though they vſed it not, &amp;c. Now, how needfull this ſobrietie is, to the keeping firſt of faith and true religion: is ſeene by thoſe, which for too much loue of this world &amp; the things thereof, are wont to fal from the trueth: and others, which neuer thinke vppon amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life: &amp; others, in ſome part, to whome God giueth ſome conſideration: as Demas, of of whome the Apoſtle ſaieth, Demas forſooke me, louing this preſent world. And the Lord Ieſus when he had ſaid, <hi>Take heede, leaſt your hearts be ouer loaden with ſurfeting and aron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes:</hi> he added, of this other part of dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: ſaying: <hi>And the cares of this life: and ſo that laſt day come vpon you.</hi> For whence are theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21305:15"/>cares, but of too much loue of this life? but then there is a third kinde of dronkenneſſe, which is more peſtilent then both the other, by how much more ſubtile it is, and pertaineth more to the minde then to the fleſh: namely, a dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of carnall wiſedome, vaine eloquence, and worldlie philoſophie. For who ſo bee addicted to theſe, as to ſweet and counterfeit wines, and therewith bee delighted, and truſt vppon them: they then loathing the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of chriſtian doctrine, will verie ſoone and eaſily make ſhipwracke of their faith: Of which thing the Apoſtle Saint Paule ſaieth: <hi>Bevvare leaſt there bee any man that ſpoyle you, through philoſophie and vaine deceit.</hi> For while wee goe about to meaſure with our carnall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and rules of humane learning, the miſteries of God, which the holy ghoſt hath deliuered vnto vs in a ſimple and plaine ſtile and methode: being ouer weighed with the diuine glorie, which we are not able to beare, we fall headlong into the deepe pitt of diuers hereſies: as it happened to Arrius, Marcion and almoſt all the heretikes: ſeeing <hi>the vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh, is enmitie againſt God:</hi> and <hi>the fleſhlie man doeth not perceiue, nor can perceiue the thinges that are of God: for they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21305:15"/>are fooliſhneſſe vnto him.</hi> By this, which (ſo much as the ſhortnes of an epiſtle maye ſuffer) I haue ſpoken of the three ſortes of dronkenneſſe: how neceſſary the contrarie ſobrietie is, to reſiſt the enemies, and to keep ſafe the treaſure of diuine wiſedome: as you, (my noble Earle,) doe verie well knowne, ſo I thinke there is none, but he may, if he will, vnderſtand. VVhat if I adioyned likewiſe, that blinde and too exceeding loue of our tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and maiſters? wherewith we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are for the moſt part ſo dronken: that whatſoeuer is ſaid and written by them, the ſame without all iudgement and proofe wee imbrace and hold with tooth and nayle, euen as the oracles of the holy ghoſt: contrary to the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: <hi>Trye all thinges, hold that vvhich is good.</hi> Let vs therefore bee ſober, and watch.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Our weapons or armour moreouer, are not carnall, but ſpirituall, as the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and are of two ſortes: ſome to defend our ſelues: and ſome vſed for offence of the enemies. Of the firſt ſort, are, the helmett, breſt-plate, girdle, and ſhield: of the other ſort, the ſword, and darts.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore the head of the inward man,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21305:16"/>muſt bee armed with the helmet of ſaluation: that is, with the aſſured hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as it is already begunne in vs, through Chriſt by his onely grace, ſo it ſhall bee made perfect through him, by the ſame grace. For vnleſſe he haue this aſſured hope, who can be able to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the battaile, and to continue the ſame? The breaſt, where the vitall partes lye, muſt bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med round about with the breaſt-plate of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes I ſay, of righteouſnes of faith eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of a good conſcience. For who is able to ſtand to coape with ſo many and ſo great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the battaile: vnleſſe he bee perſuaded that God ſtandeth his helper and fauourer by him: and doth from his heart hate iniquity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which; &amp; loueth righteouſnes, for which the battaile is begunne?</p>
            <p>We muſt haue our loynes girt about with the girdle of trueth: and our feete ſhodd with the knowledge of the goſpell of peace: that is, it behooueth vs to bee ſo armed on all partes, with the knowledge, loue, and might of the trueth: that we muſt be euer ready and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to fight for the goſpell: holding in our left hand the ſhield of faith, wherewith we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and quench all the fiery darts of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie: but in our right hand, the ſword of the word of God, wherewith the enemie may bee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21305:16"/>driuen back and wounded. VVe ſhall indeed vſe the ſhield of faith, if againſt al the ſophiſmes and ſubtelties of heretikes, wee hold faſt thoſe principles of faith, whereof we ſpake, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee bee to ſeeke in refelling their fine and ſubtle quirks, &amp; then haue we vſe of the ſword of the word, if we conuince the enemies by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent teſtimonies of ſcriptures, and reaſons drawne by neceſſary conſequence from them? to which purpoſe it preuailes not a little, if wee caſt at the enemies, ſharp pointed darts, &amp; ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging arrowes out of the quiuers of the auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fathers: as alſo we ſee thoſe laeter fathers themſelues haue done, bringing forth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies and arguments of their predeceſſors, againſt heretikes.

            <p n="9">9 To the preſeruation of the cittie and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of each cittizen, howe needfull it is, that, the cittie being cleane voide of all the enemies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers, hirelings, cloſe workers, and traytors, may liue the more ſafely and quietly: who, that hath any ſight at all in things paſt and preſent, can be ignorant? Therefore the church gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21305:17"/>and magiſtrats muſt take great care: that according to the Apoſtles diſcipline, it may heedfully be lookt vnto, what doctrine each one profeſſeth, and what life he leadeth: &amp; they which being taught and admoniſhed will not amend: to let them bee made knowne to the whole congregation openly, &amp; ſeparated from the holy aſſemblies, and from the conuerſation with the other faithfull: leaſt by their contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others ſhould alſo be infected: or leaſt (as the Apoſtle ſaieth) <hi>a little leuen marre the whole lump.</hi> But to euery of the faithfull, let ſuch obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate men, be as Ethnicks and Publicanes: and let this ſaying of Iohn bee kept, <hi>if any man come vnto you, bringing not this doctrine,</hi> namely, which the Apoſtles haue deliuered concerning the ſonne of God, and concerning the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of chriſtian religion: <hi>him receiue not into houſe, nether bid him, god ſpeed.</hi> This diſcipline is perpetuall in the church: of which Tertullian in apolog. the 39 chapter ſpeaketh. <hi>The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate further, is to puniſh by Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the qualitie of their faults or blaſphemies.</hi>

            <p n="10">10 That which in the ende wee ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the laſt duetie of each cittizen: the ſame is alſo in this buſineſſe which wee haue in hand, verie eaſie to bee knowne; I would it were as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21305:17"/>eaſie to bee performed. Our faith therefore which we giue and promiſe in Baptiſme muſt conſtantly bee kept vnto our prince Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to our laſt ende; yea if need be, euen to the ſpilling of our blood and our liues. And therefore that doctrine, which by the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt principles of faith, and alſo by common conſent of the whole auncient church, wee knowe aſſuredly to bee the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt: the ſame wee muſt hold and keepe with a moſt conſtant faith, againſt all new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: neither muſt we onely keepe them in our mindes, but alſo freely confeſſe the ſame with our mouths, and openly profeſſe that we will neuer bee willing to decline from the ſame: and ſo we muſt profeſſe it, that vnleſſe wee doe it, wee can hope for no ſaluation.

For we while we are in this world,

Whereuppon the ſame Lord, ſtirring vs vp to this confesſion, added: <hi>He which confeſſeth me before men, him will I alſo confeſſe before my father.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt neither be allured by commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to betray Chriſt, neither muſt we be ska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by threatnings and puniſhments, from free confesſing of him: but rather fixing our eyes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame Lord, the captaine and perfecter of our faith, who with a willing gladnes ſuffred the torment on the croſſe, not caring for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, &amp; ſitteth at the right hand of the throne of God, we muſt conſtantly runne out our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed race.

            </p>
            <p>By theſe tenne pointes (noble Earle) I hope I haue declared the right meanes, by which, in this ſo great diuerſitie of opinions, about the way of ſaluation: in ſo great inuaſion &amp; mighty power of euill ſpirits: and in ſo cruell tyrannie of the deuill, euerie one may prouide for the ſafetie of him and his.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21305:18"/>
            <p>I haue now almoſt 34. yeares by Gods good gift, done my endeauour, that I might my ſelfe follow the ſame courſe: and beſides the holie ſcriptures, which do teach apparently, that it is according to Gods will, I haue learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many yeares, that it is a heauenlie and excellent waye. For vppon the very ſame occaſion, leauing the Babylonicall captiuitie, I gatt me into the free churches of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as into defenſed citties: Firſt to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Rhetia, where I liued eight months and more: afterwards vnto Geneua where likewiſe I abode nine months: From thence I came to Strausburgh, where then floriſhed the French church: and there I liued and taught 11. yeares: but not without ſome conflict, after the death of that ornament of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth and parent of the ſchoole Iames Sturmius, and the loſſe of the graue elders. After this, being called to Cleue, I was paſtor in that church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure yeares: with what fruite, though not without my croſſe, your Hon. doth verie well know, who (ſuch was your ſingular piety) were euer my hearer, and no ſmale helper both with your labour and authoritie, in ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the kingdome of Chriſt. Afterwards in the raigne of that great &amp; incomparable prince Frederike the 3. I profeſſed tenne yeares in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21305:19"/>vniuerſitie at Heidelberg: and at length I came to Neuſtade, the famous &amp; moſt valiant prince Iohn Casſimiers towne, where in the ſchoole newly erected I haue taught ſeuen yeares and more: And where, as yet being a withered old man, but yet by Gods good fauour in good health, I liue by my princes liberalitie: And as by little and little I die vnto the world in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſo I doe my beſt eudeauour that I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more and more die vnto it in minde: I wiſh it indeed. For <hi>the vvorld paſſeth avvay, and the luſtes thereof:</hi> And the little worme in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, in a little houres ſpace, ſo gnawed the roote of the gourde, vnder the ſhaddow whereof he laye ſecure: that it being withered away, the good prophet had not wherewith to ſhade himſelfe from the exceeding heat of the ſunne. This very meanes. I wiſh that mine owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may alſo follow.</p>
            <p>VVhich is alſo a principall cauſe, why I was willing now to publiſh this ſumme of all the chriſtian doctrin, not onely in the name of my ſelfe, but alſo of my whole familie, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I writt long ſince for another vſe &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but now brought forth into light, becauſe that my children, beſides the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus which they dayly heare deliuered in our congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: may haue alſo mine owne forme
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21305:19"/>of the ſame chriſtian faith, left vnto them by me, which they may follow. For although touching the ſubſtance of chriſtian doctrine, I teach nothing in this my confesſion, different from that which is preached in our churches: yet, for that I am not ignorant, how much the authoritie and example of parents preuaileth with children: therefore I deemed that I ſhould doe a thing, not a little beneficiall vnto them, if I ſhould leaue behinde me in Chriſts church ſome picture or image of my ſelfe; I meane, not of my countenance, but of my faith: which they might often looke vppon, and by which they might be more and more encouraged to the ſtudie of the holy ſcriptures, to proceed in the knowledge of the trueth, and finally, to the conſtancie and perſeuerance in true pietie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it vnknowne vnto me, that hereunto belonged that which the Apoſtle writt to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie: <hi>If there be any man that prouideth not for his owne, and namely them of his houſhold, he denyeth the faith, and is vvorſe then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ioyne alſo another cauſe, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth properly to my ſelf &amp; mine own eſtate. That which hitherto I haue in heart beleeued, &amp; with my mouth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, yea &amp; many years, publikely taught in the church, both by word,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21305:20"/>&amp; by bookes publiſhed: my deſire was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the ſame wholly in one iuſt volume: that all poſteritie might knowe what my faith hath beene: and that all the faithfull, both now liuing, and to come, and ſo all the true catholike church, may euidently vnderſtand, that I neuer conſented to ſuch hereſies as do now ſpread all about, or euer heretofore did ſpread: ſpecially, ſeing that if I haue beene deceiued in any one thing, I ſubmit me to right iudgement therein, and I wiſh that my eſcape may be examined &amp; reformed by the touchſtone of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by the analogie of faith.</p>
            <p>Now to dedicate this my booke vnto your Hon. I was induced by many and thoſe verie honeſt cauſes; which I truſt ſhall not bee diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, either of you, or any other good man.</p>
            <p>It was meet that a booke, not ill, containing good doctrin, ſhould haue a good patron: who both for his pietie would, and for his learning could, defend the ſame: and that conſtantly: whereunto, how much the nobilitie of blood, and generoſity of minde, if they be ioyned with true pietie, can help, we haue learned by long expetience. For it is proper vnto a noble man, to be conſtant in a matter commendable, and worthie of honor: and not to ſuffer himſelfe to be carried away from any honeſt purpoſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21305:20"/>by weale or woe. Sinceritie and conſtancy are ſuch vertues, as cannot fall into ruſticall and ſcruile mindes. Add hereunto, that I iudged it a thing honeſt and neceſſarie, that there ſhould ſome monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be extant to all men in all ages, of my duetiful obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to you, &amp; of our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friendſhip. For the friendſhip which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of vertue, and is therefore ſincere and ſound, is a thing both with God and men moſt worthie of all praiſe: ſuch as was betweene Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Ionathan: Peter and Iohn, Paule and Barnabas. For as <hi>all haue not faith,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid, ſo al haue not true friendſhip: &amp; as faith, ſo alſo loue is from God, ſaith Iohn: and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from true pietie and vertue. Ours, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, was not ſetled, through fleſh and blood: but through Chriſt, pietie, religion, and loue of the ſame religion: whereunto afterwards, was added a likeneſſe of our mindes, ſtudies, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and a moſt ſweet conuerſing together for many yeares, whereby the ſame was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and ſo confirmed that it could not by any, though very great diſtance of place, no not in many yeares, bee diminiſhed or weakened. What? that it hath not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to firme and conſtant: but alſo hath euer, and ſtil doth ſeeme more and more daily to increaſe: the holy ghoſt more and more kindling this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21305:21"/>brotherly loue in our hearts? I ſurely for my part do well feele, how great a deſire is in me, both to ſee you, and to ſpeake with you, yea and to imbrace you in the Lord: as alſo I well vnderſtand, both by your letters vnto me, and by your kinde dealings in my behalfe, what great care you haue of me. So true friendſhip, which is wrought by the ſpirite of God, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wont, continually to be preſerued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>And ſurely ſuch good things as proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and may alſo be for the profite of others: thoſe wee ought to ſhew forth &amp; celebrate by al meanes that we can, for his glory, &amp; the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our brethren. Therefore as it was Gods will, that the particular leagues of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of ſome of the Saintes ſhould be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſcriptures: ſo this of ours, ought not to be buried in perpetuall ſilence.</p>
            <p>Hereunto alſo, beſides that with your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar beneuolence &amp; fauour, you haue reſpected, not onely my ſelfe (as is ſaid) but alſo my deare kinſe-men, and all that honeſt and chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of the <hi>Limacii:</hi> ſuch alſo, haue beene your good benefites and offices towards me: that vnleſſe I would bee vtterly vnthankfull: I muſt needes minde, if not a full recompence, yet at leaſt an honeſt declaration of a gratefull heart:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21305:21"/>eſpecially ſeing true friendſhip cannot conſiſt among the vnthankfull. Now, what was I able to performe, either better acceptable to you, or more beſeeming your pietie, vertue, and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I ſhould dedicate vnto your name, this little booke, wherein, in as much breuitie and perſpicuitie as I could, I haue comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſumme of our whole chriſtian doctrine? For what kinde of man each one is, and what manner of ſtudy, knowledge, and religion each one profeſſeth, ſuch kinde of works are vſed, and indeed ought to bee dedicated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him. So Luke did write the Acts to his [both in deed and in name] Theophylus: So Caelius Lactantius, his chriſtian inſtitutions, to the moſt chriſtian emperour Conſtantine: So Ambroſe his godly bookes of faith, and of the holy ſpirit, to that religious emperour Gratian. So laſtly, (to ſtay no longer in a matter euident) all wiſe men, haue choſen ſuch patrons for their bookes, as were the bookes: that the title of the bookes might be anſwerable to their profesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to whome they were dedicated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſith I could in no ſort better recompence your deſerts towards me, then by dedication of this booke: I deſire and beſeech you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with your curteous acceptation, this [howe ſmall a preſent ſoeuer] perpetuall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21305:22"/>of my loue towards you: and that your ſelfe would ſtill continue in that kindnes which you ſhew to me. And for my children, T. Cornelius: Ludowike: Hierome: Robert: Lael: Conſtantia: Anna: Lydia: Violanthes, with their moſt louing mother, and my deare wife, in the Lord, R. Liuia, I moſt hartely deſire, they may eſpecially after my death, be commended to your good fauour.</p>
            <p>Thus for mine owne part, [my noble Lord] I pray that your yeares may bee as manie as mine are: whereby you may ſtill bee a benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor both to yours and my friends, as alſo to our churches, as hitherto you haue beene: but ſo I wiſh that you may reach to my yeares and beyond, without thoſe diſcommodities which are wont to accompany crooked old age: and in reſpect wherof, he that ſaid, <hi>it is a good thing to bee old</hi> added thereunto, <hi>but not to bee twiſe old for old age commeth not alone.</hi> For euen to liue being old is wont to be a heauie burden to old men: ſo that they muſt rather meditate on death and on the graue, then on life, whereof the very name in greeke doth put vs in minde. For the worde ſignifying <hi>an old man</hi> in that tongue importeth as much, as one that looketh on the ground.</p>
            <p>But ſeing both <hi>to liue,</hi> of it ſelfe is the great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21305:22"/>blesſing of God, and may be to the profite of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and alſo thoſe very diſcommodities of life, which follow old age, are profitable to the ſpirite in godlie men: for theſe cauſes, to pray for the long life of ſome godly man, is no euill prayer, but very good: although old age can not want ſome inconueniences. The God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie therefore vouchſafe to preſerue your Hon. in ſound health, and a good and long life for the profite of many, to his good pleaſure. <hi>Health and wiſedome are two good bleſſings in mans life.</hi>

We therefore did alwaies like wel of that ſaying of Leo the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21305:54"/>firſt,
<note place="margin">Epi. 10. c. 4</note> writing vnto Flauianus about the ſame thing, where he ſaith. <hi>He which is true God, the ſame is alſo true man, and in this vnitie there is no vntrueth, whereas there meet together the baſeneſſe of manhood, and the excellencie of the godhead. For as God is not chaunged by the partaking, ſo man (that is mans nature in Chriſt) is not conſumed by the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, for each forme vvorketh with communion of the other, their ovvne propertie: namelie the vvord vvorketh that which is proper to the vvord, and the fleſh performeth that vvhich is proper to the fleſh.</hi> Thus farre Leo that learned man: which hee afterwards fetteth out by examples, whereby it is plainelie ſhewed, that, as the natures are truelie vnited in Chriſt, yet remaine diſtinct, and not confounded: ſo alſo were and are the actions: for thinges which were proper to the word, the fleſh did not performe, but the word &amp; that which was proper to the fleſh the word performed not, but the fleſh. To raiſe againe Lazarus from death, was proper to the word: but to crie Lazarus, come forth, was proper to the fleſh: yet both thoſe actions were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the raiſing vp of Lazarus, becauſe they were both one and in one Chriſt, &amp; tend both to one purpoſe: and yet they were diſtinct.

To reſtore his ſight, that was born blinde was an action of his diuine nature: but to put clay vppon his eies, and to ſay, goe and waſh:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21305:54"/>was of the humaine nature. Therefore this perſonall vnion, as it did not confound the natures, ſo neither did it the actions, but kept them diſtinct: neither yet did it confound the properties of the natures. For there be in one &amp; the ſame perſon of Chriſt theſe three things, Natures, the proprieties and faculties of the natures, and the actions of them: and theſe proprieties of natures in Chriſt are after the verie ſame manner that the natures, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are. Therefore as it is cleere, that one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture paſſeth not into another, nor one action is confounded with another: ſo is it apparent that their proprieties are after the ſame ſorte.</p>

So herein is admitted a double, &amp; that a grecuous offence: One is, that when we communicate truelie and properlie, to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thoſe thinges which belong to God, wee make the creature equall to god. Neither can this exception ſerue to ſhift it, that God hath them of himſelfe, but the humaine nature in Chriſt taketh them of the Godhead. For euen the Sonne, is not of himſelfe, nor hath he his diuine eſſence of himſelfe, but of the Father: yet is he notwithſtanding equall to the father and hath the ſame nature with the Father. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother offence is, that vvhile vve attribute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſo infinite proprieties to the humaine nature, as infinite povver: we depriue the ſame of the ovvne and proper qualitie: not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe then the glorie of the reſurrection ſhall depriue our bodies of the baſeneſſe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, vvhen it ſhall bee truelie communicated vnto them: and not othervviſe then the cleare light of the Sunne, if it bee let into the ayre, vvhich vvas lightened onelie vvith the light of a candell, it extinguiſheth that light.

But ſith this hereſie, euen in our time, is largely and plainly refelled by many learned men: we which doe here exhibite this briefe &amp; ſimple confeſſion of our faith to the church of God, and to all poſteritie, will add no more to that which hath bin ſaid.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Act. 20.28</note> vvhenas the force of the redemption pertained to the god head, the ſhedding of his blood onelie to the manhood.

Firſt that being touched with an earneſt griefe of our whole life ledd amiſſe, wee might deſire from our heart to haue our mindes, and ſo all our affections chaunged &amp; renued into the obedience of the diuine will: and that we might earneſtly pray and doe our beſt endeuour, that it might be ſo: Secondlie that, imbracing Chriſt by a true faith, withall his treaſures, wee might beleeue firmely, and without any wauering, that all our ſinnes are for euer pardoned, of the fauour and mercie of god through Chriſt alone, and we receiued into grace, made the children of God, and heires of euerlaſting life: Laſtly, that beeing thus perſwaded of the free and eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Ieſus Chriſt, wee ſhould thence foreward labour by all meanes, to obſerue whatſoeuer Chriſt hath commaunded, to the glorie of God, and profite of our neighbour: ſo, as faith do euermore accompanie vs to the ende, whereby we beleeue, that howſoeuer in this new obedience, we err or do offend, yet for Chriſts ſake it ſhall not be imputed to vs: but contrariewiſe, by the perfect obedience, iuſtice, and holineſſe of chriſt imputed vnto

<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note> looking for that bleſſed hope, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the glorie of the great God.

                  <p>And nowe of that which is alreadie ſaide, it appeareth, that we do not confound the Law with the Goſpell. For albeit wee confeſſe that God is author aſwel of the Law as of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and that of it ſelfe, it is as well holie, iuſt,
<note place="margin">Exo. 20</note> and good, as the goſpell:
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.12</note> yet we hold that ther is no ſmale difference betwixt them both: not onely becauſe the Lawe was deliuered to the Iſraelites alone, and the goſpell pertaineth to al people and nations: and alſo, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was for a time, and to continue but till chriſt, and the goſpell is euerlaſting: and alſo not onely becauſe, that was deliuered by Moſes, and declared by the Prophets, and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21305:71"/>goſpell was brought by chriſt, and publiſhed to the whole world by the Apoſtles: But indeed and moſt eſpecially for theſe cauſes: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of the law, is onely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes with irreuocable curſes thereunto ioyned, if they bee broken neuer ſo little: It hath alſo promiſes, not onely of earthlie but alſo of heauenly bleſſings: but al of them with the condition of perfect obedience, and none merely free. But the goſpell is properly a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie meſſage, ſetting before vs <hi>gratis</hi> chriſt the redeemer, forgiuing ſinnes and ſauing vs: yea and requiring nothing at our handes for the obtaining of life euerlaſting, but a true faith in chriſt, which faith cannot bee without true repentance, nor without a care to doe the will of God, that is, to liue ſo berly, iuſtly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as is aboue declared. Moreouer becauſe the law did not performe, that which it required; nether had it power whereby to ſaue, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was vnſufficient, and a killing letter, the miniſter of wrath and death, more prouoking then taking away ſin: But the Goſpell, what it requireth, the ſame it performeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatſoeuer it offereth, the ſame alſo it truely imparteth vnto vs: For as much as the holy ghoſt is by it powerful in the elect, at the preaching of the Goſpell: ſtirring vp in them that true faith, wherby they apprehend chriſt offred, and with him eternall life: For faith is by hearing of the Goſpell:
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17</note> but obedience is not by hearing of the Lawe: becauſe the holie
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21305:71"/>ſpirite giueth no man ſtrength to the hearing of the Lawe, by which hee might obſerue the ſame, as he ſtirreth vp faith in the elect, to the hearing of the goſpell.

Whereon alſo followeth the third difference: namely, that the Law was not written in their hearts, but remained written onely in tables, and therfore did not chaunge men: But the Goſpell is written by the holie ghoſt in the hearts of the elect, &amp; therefore it chaungeth and renueth them,

                  <p>Of this which we haue ſaid, it alſo plainelie appeareth, what our faith is of the abrogation of the law by the goſpell.

<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10 Ioh. 1.17</note> that <hi>all theſe things vvere inioyned vntill the time of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> and that, <hi>The Law was giuen by Moſes

So far alſo we confeſſe that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, touching the curſſe againſt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, is abrogated by the goſpell of Chriſt: according to that of the Apoſtle:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1</note> 
                     <hi>There is no conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation to them that are in Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> where of this is a token, <hi>that they walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> But now ſo farre forth as the doctrine of the Goſpell requireth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the holineſſe of life, and that we liue ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly: therein it taketh not away the law concerning ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners: for it is wholy conſonant and agreeable with the doctrine of the goſpel of eſchewing vices and following vertue. Laſtlye, in as much as Chriſt in his goſpel did not take away the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke lawes of the nations, which were not contrarie to the law of nature: Therefore wee thinke it lawfull and free for any gouernors to bringe among their ſubiectes ſuch politick lawes as were deliuered to the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and by the ſame, (then which none are more iuſt) to rule and gouerne the people. Therefore they do exceeding great iniurie to the Goſpell of Chriſt, that ſaye it troubleth or ouerthroweth common-wealthes. This is our faith concerning the goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

For that wherof any thing is a Sacrament, can not be the Sacrament it ſelfe, nor parte of the Sacrament: ſith euerie Sacrament is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of ſome other thing then it ſelfe.

For we acknowledge &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a ſacramentall, that is, ſuch an vnion, as is agreeable to a ſacrament, with the thinges of the Sacrament.

But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, aſwell that of the ſacraments, as this of the word with the things themſelues, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth or dependeth vpon the wil and counſell of God the inſtitutor: who when he inſtituted the preaching of the goſpell, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacraments, did inſtitute them to this ende and purpoſe (as is declared;) both that we, hearing the word, and ſeeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſignes, ſhould by &amp; by lift vpp the eyes of our minde to the things ſignified by them: &amp; beeing offred vnto vs, ſhould receiue them with the hands of faith: and might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be vnited vnto Chriſt, whom they preach vnto vs, and ſhewe as it were with the finger, by their ſignification.

                  <p>Hereby we are alſo confirmed in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that as the bread is not properlie the verie bodie of Chriſt, but a ſacrament thereof: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Chriſt is not in the bread, reallie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. For in ſacraments, the thinges whereof they bee ſacraments, are not really included, although they borrowe their names of the things, as in baptiſme the matter is apparent and out of all queſtion: in which no man ſaith that the blood of Chriſt, by which we are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from ſinne, or the verie regeneration it ſelfe is included, as alſo in the worde of the goſpell, the thinges are not therein really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded which by it be declared.

And if this be impious to bee ſpoken, neither do wee thinke that the other can godlily be affirmed.

For what elſe is it to eate, then to receiue &amp; vnite vnto thee meate for the nouriſhment of that part, to which it is ordained, after a due ſort? But the fleſh of Chriſt (as hath beene ſaid) is food of the minde, not of the bellie. Neither vndoubtedly, is the fleſh of Chriſt otherwiſe eaten, then in reſpect that it was killed for vs, and made bloodleſſe, as the words do ſound, and the breaking of the bread doth repreſent; and that truely alſo, euen as the paſſeouer, and all the ſacrifices were eaten. But now his body liueth, and can not bee without blood: as at
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21305:88"/>the firſt ſupper it was neither without blood, nor dead. And therefore wee cannot without ſacriledge affirme, that it paſſeth properly &amp; that by the mouth into our bodies. And to what ende alſo, as the ſacrament of bread is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without wine, &amp; the wine without bread: ſo in the ſupper, the bodie is giuen without blood, and the blood ſeuerally without the bodie: but that wee might know, that theſe his owne ſubſtances, as they are properly in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, doe not paſſe through our mouthes, but are receiued onely by a faithfull reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, effectually ſtirred vp by the holy ghoſt? For this did the Lord himſelfe require, ſaying, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> and in ſaying, <hi>This is my bodie which is giuen for you.</hi> For in ſpeaking thus, he required in them faith, whereby they might beleeue this. and beleeuing might eate: that is, might apply it vnto themſelues for the food and life of their ſoules.

                  <p>Moreouer ſith this manner of eating the fleſh of Chriſt, namely, by faith, is both ſure, and profitable to ſaluation: And the other, namely of eating it with the bodilie mouth, cannot be prooued out of the holy ſcripturs: and admit that ſomewhat might probably be alleadged for it, yet it is not neceſſarie, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing at all profite the ſoule, but bringeth with it into the church many miſchiefes, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous heriſies, idolatries, ſtirres, ſchiſmes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of congregations: yea, makes chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion to be a ſcorne and deriſion to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells: we therefore beleeue, that piety willeth al of vs, contenting our ſelues with that kinde of eating, which in the ſupper is made by faith and by the ſpirite, wee ſhould not regard the other kinde, but bidding it farewel, we ſhould reuerently imbrace brotherly charitie, and peace, to which ende alſo the ſupper was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.

Wee hold therefore, that if we be truely and indeed vnited with Chriſt, &amp; ſo with his fleſh and blood: and, if we truely eate his fleſh and drinke his blood: then the ſame Chriſt not onely in his deitie but alſo in his fleſh and blood is preſent vnto them that are vnited vnto him, and do eare his fleſh and drinke his blood. For what can be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to thee, then that which thou eateſt and drinkeſt? and to which, thou in thine owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance art coupled, and from which, as from thy head, life and motion is imparted to thee as into a member?</p>

Of this theſe were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts. The firſt, that they ſhould abſtaine from many thinges, which otherwiſe in ſome ſorte might be ſuffred in lay-men: ſuch as are
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21305:136"/>many delights of the fleſh, glorious pompes, ſumptuous feaſts, coſtly furnitures, prophane attendants, and ſuch like matters. The ſecond, that they ſhould caſt aſide al buſineſſes of this life, which might hinder from doing their duetie, which conſiſteth chiefly in lawfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the holie things, in preaching the word, and exerciſing the diſcipline of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: ſuch buſineſſes are warre-fare, marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, law cauſes, looking to vittlers &amp; tipling houſes, and ſuch baſe affaires. The third, that they ſhould promiſe a peculiar obedience to their owne biſhop &amp; metropolitane of their biſhop in honeſt matters. The fourth, that they ſhould more diligently then the lay-men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the reading and ſtudie of the holie ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and thoſe artes and tongues, whereby the ſcriptures may the better bee vnderſtood, and likewiſe their prayers and holy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations. The fift, that they ſhould alſo apply themſelues with a more diligent care, not one ly to the proper duetie commaunded vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, but alſo to all thoſe thinges which may ſeeme to appertaine to edification of the whole church.</p>

            <p>One great learned man write vnto me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>Whereas you write vnto me concerning your confeſſion: it hath beene read ouer both by me, by N. and others, with great pleaſure: which is written verie learnedly, and with an exquiſite methode: and if you take out that ſame, which you haue added in the ende con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Arch-biſhops and the hierarchie, it pleaſeth me paſſing well. But whenas together with the brethren N.N. which are with vs we conferred, about the way and meanes of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement among the churches of our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21305:155"/>to be begonne: they all with one conſent thought onely this, to be the ſafeſt and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt waye, that the confeſſions of faith receiued and ſet forth by euerie of the churches in each prouince, ſhould bee compoſed and framed into one harmonie: that they might bee alike (touching the ſubſtance of faith) all of them: and each church embrace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their owne.

               <p>Here in the firſt part to the name of Chriſt, is added the ſonne of man: in the other parte, the ſonne of God, God: that we might ſhewe, how that diuine attributes are ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt the man: and humaine, of Chriſt God: ſeing the very perſon of Chriſt is ment in either part. For the ſame Chriſt, one and the ſame perſon,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21305:159"/>is whole God, &amp; whole man, though not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as Damaſcene ſpeaketh) for in two diſtinct natures he ſubſiſteth one and the very ſame. This doth Damaſcene thus declare lib. 3. cap. 7. <hi>The whole Chriſt is perfect God; but the vvhole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Chriſt, is not onely God; for it is not onely God but alſo man. And the vvhole Chriſt is perfect man, but the whole ſubſiſtance of Chriſt is not onely man; for it is not onely man but alſo God. For the whole ſubſiſtance doth repreſent the nature; but whole Chriſt, the perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas we ſpake of his actions, done by him either according to his humane nature, or according to his diuine, that yet one and the ſame and whole Chriſt performeth the ſame: it depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon this that the actions were (as the ſchools ſay) of ſuppoſite natures. But the diuerſitie of the actions proceedeth from the diuerſneſſe of the natures or formes by which they were done. Sith therefore there is in Chriſt two natures, and but one perſon, thereon it comes, that there is but onely <hi>one worker, namely whole Chriſt, two natures that can worke; and two kinde of actions.</hi> Now theſe actions are called the actions of God and man, not ſo much for that they proceede from one agent which is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, God and man: as that not onely the deitie, but alſo the humanitie meet together for this worke of our ſaluation: each ioyning his actions, with the others actions. And this is the firſt and principal force of this hypoſtaticall, or perſonall vnion: namely that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21305:159"/>by it, the two natures, and their properties &amp; actions, are ſo vnited in one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: that he, who, by the forme of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning ſubſiſted, is God, and by the forme of a ſeruant, wherein he now ſubſiſteth, is man: and the ſame being whole God, is whole man, and being whole man, is whole God: and conſequently is wholy om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and euerie where preſent, &amp; whole inomnipotent, and exiſting in a certen place: and the ſame whole died, and whole by dying deſtroyed death. And thus it finally follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that to the obtaining, communicating, &amp; applying of our ſaluation, not onely his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature worketh, but alſo the humaine worketh with it.</p>
               <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d force followeth of the firſt: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the humaine nature was made the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inſtrument vnited perſonally thereunto: and therefore a moſt forcible and effectuall inſtrument, to beſtow all benefites vpon vs.</p>
               <p>The third, that by this vnion, this maſſe or lumpe of humaine nature, is lifte vpp to ſuch dignitie, that we neither can nor ought to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our actions of adoration, faith, prayer, &amp; loue, to the onely deitie of Chriſt: as is declared in the confeſſion.

               <p>The fourth force is, that becauſe this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature is perſonally vnited to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: therefore the gifts of God, conferred v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

               <p>But how? not ſo as that (for example) it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that infinite perſon within the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des or limitts of it owne finite or determinate ſubſtance: or that it ſpredd it ſelfe, as it were ſtretched out, into the largeneſſe of it. And that which wee ſay of this propertie, the ſame is to bee thought and beleeued of all the reſt: becauſe they all remaine vnchaungeable and vnmixed. How then was the humaine nature taken? ſurely, it was ſo taken into vnitie of the ſame perſon: that yet it is not made the verie perſon: but rather exiſteth in the perſon, is borne and ſuſtained of the perſon, and euer dependeth wholly vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>For this vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the natures according to the <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or vniting of the <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> is made without alteration, confuſion or diuiſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Whereby it alſo followeth, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taken, (to ſpeake properly) is not a part of this perſon, as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>For like as of the vnion of the two natures, there is not framed a third nature, ſo, neither
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21305:161"/>by taking the humaine nature into vnity of the diuine perſon, is there framed, as it were a new perſon, which ſhould be the proper perſon of Chriſt, and ſhould differ from the perſon of <hi>the word,</hi> which is <hi>the word</hi> it ſelfe. For it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the verie ſame, nor doth it differ from it ſelfe, except herein, that the ſame which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely in <hi>the forme of God,</hi> and was onely God: now ſubſiſteth alſo in the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp; is alſo man: and before, was as a king naked, but is nowe clothed with our fleſh, as with a purple garment: ſo that for this cauſe, the fathers not amiſſe, called the ſame (in ſome ſort) a compounded perſon. But marke alſo this difference, beſids the reſt, that the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pertaineth not to the eſſence of a king: but the humaine nature in Chriſt, is in ſuch ſorte, that without it, cannot be defined what Chriſt is.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Which is the cauſe, why the humaine nature thus take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be reputed &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as it were a part of the perſon of Chriſt: namely becauſe it is ſo taken into vnity of his perſon: that as <hi>the vvorde</hi> with this humaine fleſh, is ſaid to be, and is man: ſo alſo this fleſh in <hi>the word,</hi> and with <hi>the word God,</hi> is ſaid to be, and is God: as Athanaſius, Gregorie, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, Damaſcene, and other fathers haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of the ſcriptures: for that fleſh, is God, not by nature, but by <hi>Hypoſtaſie;</hi> in which ſenſe, the ſame fleſh, is omnipotent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places, whereuppon it comes alſo,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:21305:161"/>that what honour belongeth to <hi>the word,</hi> of it ſelfe: the ſame is alſo to bee giuen to the fleſh in <hi>the word</hi> and for <hi>the word:</hi> becauſe of them both there is but one and the ſame <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Add this moreouer, for better explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſake, that <hi>the word,</hi> although whereſoeuer it bee, (and it is in all places) there alſo the ſame is not onely god, but alſo man, and that becauſe, it hath in all places, the humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnited therunto by <hi>Hypoſtaſie:</hi> yet, where ſoeuer it is it ſelfe, it doth not make it ſelfe an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or perſonal, to the humaine nature, but only there, where the ſame nature exiſteth: namely ſo, as that nature is ſuſtained, borne, and wrought or mooued by it.</p>
               <p>For how ſhould the ſame be ſaid to bee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, where it doth not exiſt? the feete are ſuſtained by the ſoule, not whereſoeuer the the ſoule is, be it in the head: but onely where they themſelues are exiſting. When the fleſh was in the virgins wombe: <hi>the word</hi> being then perſonally vnited vnto it, did not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuſtaine the ſame, out of the wombe of Marie: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> vnto it in the womb, which ſuſtained the ſame there, and not in any other place: which is alſo to bee ſaid of all the time of Chriſts life, when he liued in diuers places. Likewiſe after his death it was <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bodie, when it was dead and buried, &amp; ſuſtained the ſame in it ſelfe: but where? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not in heauen where the bodie was not:
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21305:162"/>but onely in the graue: euen as alſo it was <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis</hi> to his ſoule ſeparated from his bodie, not in the graue, but out of the graue, &amp; ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame in it ſelfe. And now it ſuſtaineth both the ſoule and bodie together, in heauen, not in earth: much leſſe euerie where.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Neither doth it follow vppon this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that the perſonall vnion is diſſolued, neither doeth it come to paſſe that the whole perſon is not <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to the fleſh, but onely in parte. The reaſon is becauſe this perſon of <hi>the word,</hi> as it is infinite, ſo alſo is it moſt ſimple and pure, and therefore both is wholly <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis</hi> to the fleſh, whereſoeuer the fleſh exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth: &amp; is alſo wholly <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the fleſh exiſteth not, being it ſelfe exiſting in the forme of god. Indeed the ſoule (as is aforeſaide) is wholly <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to the head, giuing life to it and ſuſtaining it: but where? not in euery part of the body, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that, where the head it ſelfe is: and out of the head is alſo wholly <hi>hypoſtaſis</hi> to the feet, ſuſtaining them too: not where the head is, but where the feet themſelues are. Is then the vnion which the ſoule hath with the head diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, becauſe, out of the head it is wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the feet?</p>
               <p n="8">8 Finally, that all things which haue bin ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this perſonal vnion, may more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be declared. I add theſe alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſoule is <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to the eyes: to what eyes? ſuch as they are: namely inſtruments v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21305:162"/>for ſight, not for hearing: on the other ſide to the eares, for hearing, not for ſeing. So <hi>the word</hi> was <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to the humaine nature, not to deſtroy death, which was a propertie of <hi>the word:</hi> but to ſuffer death, which was a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to the fleſh, not to this end, that the fleſh ſhould bee it and ſuch like, which, &amp; of which ſort <hi>the word</hi> is: but it ſhould be it, and ſuch like, which, and of which ſort it is it ſelfe, either by nature, or by grace reallie put into it, which they call infuſed or habitual grace. For the grace of this vnion is this, that it is taken into this vnitie of perſon.</p>
               <p>This ſame doctrine of ours is confirmed by thoſe things which are deliuered both by the ſcriptures, and the fathers concerning the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the mediatour, that is, concerning the end of his incarnation.</p>
               <p>Many ends of this incarnation are noted of the fathers in the ſcriptures, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Anſelme, in his booke intituled <hi>Cur Deus homo, why God is man:</hi> but the principall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ende was, not ſimplie that <hi>the vvorde</hi> God might ſaue vs (for he could haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by his omnipotencie, and by his onely commaundement without taking fleſh:) but that hee might by ſuch meanes ſaue vs from death, namely, by death of his owne perſon: and by his owne reſurrection, might raiſe vs to life: according to that of the Apoſtle, to the Hebr. 2. ver. 14. <hi>That by death he might deſtroye
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21305:163"/>him vvho &amp;c.</hi> And in the 2. to Tim. 1.10. <hi>VVho hath aboliſhed death and hath brought life &amp;c.</hi> To which the old church conſented, ſaying, <hi>vvho by dying deſtroyed death, and by ryſing againe repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red life.</hi> Leo the firſt declared this end, ſaying, <hi>The ſonne of God tooke our fleſh: that by one nature he might dye, by the other he might not dye.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tooke vpon him fleſh to this principal ende: that for the performing of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he might doe ſuch thinges by that fleſh, which of himſelfe being in the forme of God, hee could not performe: as, to ſuffer, and to dye. For to kill death, ſimply, he could by himſelfe haue done it: but to kill it by death he could not in himſelfe doe it, without taking mortall fleſh into vnitie of his perſon. Wherefore, <hi>the vvorde</hi> did not take fleſh, that by the fleſh it might doe ſuch actions, as were the proper actions of it ſelfe: but that it might worke our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſuch meanes, namely by the owne proper actions ioyned with the actions of our fleſh.</p>

               <p>Concerning this true and eſſentiall vnion of vs, and of our owne fleſh, with the fleſh of Chriſt, there is a notable place in Cyrill, vpon Iohn. lib. 10. cap. 13. Col. 500.</p>
               <p>We denie not, but wee are ſpiritually ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Chriſt, by true faith, and ſincere loue: but, that wee haue no manner of coniunction with him according to the fleſh, that we flatly denie: and affirme it to bee cleane againſt the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21305:163"/>ſcriptures. For who euer doubted, but Chriſt is ſo the vine, and we the braunches, that from him we draw life vnto our ſelues? Heare what Paule ſaith. <hi>Wee are all one bodie with Chriſt: for though we are many, yet in him we are one: for wee all are partakers of one bread.</hi> Doth he perchaunce thinke, that the vertue of the miſticall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is vnknowne vnto vs? Which being in vs, doeth it not alſo make Chriſt to dwell in vs corporally, by communication of the fleſh of Chriſt? For why are the members of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the members of Chriſt? know ye not, ſaith hee, that your members are the members of Chriſt? ſhal I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an harlott? God forbidd. Our Sauiour alſo ſaid. He which eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in me, and I in him: whereby wee maye conſider, that Chriſt is in vs, not onely by dwelling in vs, which is perceiued by loue: but alſo by a naturall participation. For euen as, if one take waxe melted by the fire, &amp; min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it with other waxe likewiſe melted, ſo as of them both hee make but one thing: ſo by this communication of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, he is in vs, and we in him. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this corruptible nature of the body could neuer be brought to incorruption and to life, vnleſſe the bodie of naturall life were ioyned vnto it. Beleeueſt thou not me telling thee this? Beleeue (I pray thee) Chriſt himſelfe: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily verily (ſaith he) I ſay vnto you: vnleſſe yee
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21305:164"/>ſhall eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man and drinke his blood, yee ſhall haue no life in you. He which eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood: hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him at the laſt day. Thou heareſt him plainely cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, that we ſhall haue no life, vnleſſe we drinke his blood &amp; eate his fleſh. In you (ſaieth he) your ſelues, that is, in your bodie. By life, may well bee vnderſtood the fleſh of life: for that, doth raiſe vs vpp at the laſt daye. And ſo need I not think it an vncurrant ſpeach to ſay, the fleſh of life being made fleſh of the onely begotten ſonne, is brought to the vertue of life: and therefore cannot bee ouercome of death. And therefore being made in vs, putts death from vs: For gods onely begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne, is neuer abſent from it, whereuppon becauſe he is one with his fleſh, I (ſaieth he) will raiſe him vp. Why then ſhould it be denied that we are called braunches, according to the fleſh? May it not fittly be ſaid that the vine is his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and we the braunches, for the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie or likeneſſe of our nature? For the vine &amp; the braunches are of the ſame nature. So both ſpiritually and corporally are wee the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Chriſt the vine. Thus farre Cyrill.</p>
               <p>In this whole text, Cyrills purpoſe was to ſhew: that Chriſt, not onely according to his deitie, as his aduerſaries the Neſtorians did thinke, but alſo according to the fleſh, was the vine, from which life flowed into vs as braunches: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently that we, as brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21305:164"/>were ioyned not onely to his deitie, but alſo to his humanitie, and ſo to his fleſh: &amp; doe draw life and all our ſpirituall nouriſhment, not onely from his deitie but alſo from his fleſh. And the reaſon is brought from the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaticall</hi> vnion, which maketh <hi>the word,</hi> &amp; his fleſh taken into vnitie thereof to bee but one perſon, one and the ſame Chriſt, one and the ſame vine. Therefore that we cannot be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the deitie of Chriſt, but alſo we muſt be vnited to his fleſh, nor can we draw life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, but we muſt alſo draw it from this.</p>
               <p>To declare plainly this neere and reall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of our fleſh with the fleſh of Chriſt: he brings a ſimilitude of waxe: not that it euerie way agreeth in all thinges, as is manifeſt, but becauſe it fittly ſheweth our communion with Chriſt to be reall and ſubſtantiall. And this he ment when concluding he ſaid, not onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, but alſo corporally, (that is, not onely in reſpect of the ſpirite, but alſo in reſpect of the bodie:) both Chriſt is the vine, and we his braunches. This therefore he ſpake not of the manner of our coupling to Chriſt, whether it be ſpirituall or corporall: but of the thinges which are coupled, namely, that not onely our ſoules and our ſpirites, are moſt neerely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with the ſoule and ſpirit of Chriſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our fleſh with his fleſh. This is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the aduerſaries propoſition, againſt which he argueth: which is that wee are not ioyned with Chriſt in fleſh. Coll. 500. B.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:21305:165"/>
               <p>Theſe aduerbs therefore ſpiritually &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally in Cyrill, doe not ſignifie the meanes by which we are vnited to Chriſt the vine: but the things which are vnited, as is already ſaid and declared. But the meanes alſo Cyrill grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be ſpirituall, that is by our faith, and by the ſpirite of Chriſt: for in euerie place hee teacheth, and ſpecially vpon the ſixt of Iohn, that we eate the fleſh of Chriſt by faith. And by this eating he prooueth our incorporation.</p>

               <p>When wee ſaide that the ſignification of a Sacrament, is ſo receiued, that not the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor the element alone, but the element together with the word is called a ſacrament: we ment nothing els, but that as the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21305:165"/>without the element or ſigne cannot bee ſaid to be a Sacrament: ſo neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſigne without the worde. For a Sacrament (as the church hath vſed to define it) is a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace (add) by the word, that is, by Chriſts inſtitution, conſecrated to that purpoſe: that is: altered from the common vſe to that matter.</p>
               <p>So Auguſtine Tom. 5. de ciuit.

               <p>And the ſame Auguſtine Tom. 9. in Ioh. tract. 80. ſaith concerning the word of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: <hi>the vvorde commeth to the element, and ſo is made the ſacrament, euen that viſible vvorde as it were.</hi> A ſacrament therefore according to the receiued ſignification in the church, we doe &amp; euer did acknowledge to bee a viſible ſigne: And whereof? of an inuiſible grace. But from whence hath it the vertue, to bee ſigne of ſuch a thing? from the word of Chriſt the inſtitutor: For take away the word and it ſhalbe no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: <hi>Pull away the word</hi> (ſaieth Auguſtine) <hi>and what is the water, but water?</hi> This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our words: not that the word is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or, to ſpeake properly, any parte of the Sacrament, in as much as a Sacrament is defined to bee a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace: but becauſe without the word, a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble element, cannot be a Sacrament of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21305:166"/>thing: but therefore it is the viſible ſigne of an inuiſible thing, becauſe by the word of the Lord it is inſtituted thereunto.</p>
               <p>Irenaeus alſo, making no mention of the word, (becauſe that is alwaies ſuppoſed) hath left in writing: that the Euchariſt, that is, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, conſiſteth of two matters: an earthly, (that is, the ſigne) &amp; a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly (that is, the thing ſignified) neither yet the thing ſignified, is the ſigne or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but becauſe the ſigne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be without the thing ſignified: (for elſe, wherof ſhould it bee a ſigne?) therefore hee ſaid that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt conſiſted, both of an earthly matter, (that is, the ſigne:) and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matter, (that is, the thing ſignified.)

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21305:166"/>baptized into the name of Chriſt, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in which name notwithſtanding, as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe expoundeth it, the trinitie was cloſelie ſignified, as the perſon anointed, that is, of the ſonne, in that he had taken the nature: the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon annointing, that is, the father: and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, that is, the perſon of the holie ghoſt.

               <p>Whereas wee ſaide that Paule baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoſe, of whome it is ſpoken in the 19. of the acts, as being not rightly baptized: we ſaid it without preiudice to any learned interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: for we condemne none. Onely we deſire the reader, to conſter fauourably of that word <hi>rebaptize.</hi> For we meant not, that they which were rightly baptized, were afterwards bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized againe: but they which were not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with true baptiſme, where the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God the father, the ſonne, and the holie ghoſt went before it: they, after Paule had taught them the true and ſound doctrine of Chriſt: then they tooke true baptiſme: and after baptiſme, by the laying on of handes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holy ghoſt, and the gifts thereof: &amp; this, to ſpeake properly, was indeed not to be rebaptized, but to be truely baptized.</p>
               <p>Now why I thought ſo, and do yet thinke: I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21305:168"/>was induced by the authoritie both of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and eſpecially Ambroſe, and Hierome ſo expounding that place: and alſo by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon drawne from the text it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Touching the authoritie: firſt, neuer any of the fathers did teach that theſe words, <hi>(and when they heard it they vvere baptized)</hi> were the words of Paule, ſpoken of them, which heard Iohn Baptiſt: but expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them as the words of Luke, ſpoken of them which heard Paule. So Chryſoſtome Tom. 3. in act. hom. 40. So Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in act. ca. 19. So Auguſtine Tom. 7. cont. Petil. ca. 7. So Gregory Tom. 1. in euang. hom. 20. So Bede in act. ca. 19. So all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer moſt of them do in plaine tearms write that theſe twelue diſciples were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Paule, or at leaſt by Paules comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as hauing not bin rightly baptized before, becauſe they heard not the doctrine of the holie ghoſt, nor were baptized into his name. Ambroſius Tom. 2. de ſpi. ſan. ad Theo. imp. ca. 3.</p>
               <p>Laſtly they themſelues alſo, which ſaid, wee haue not ſo much as heard, whether there be an holy ghoſt, were afterwards baptized in the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded vnto grace, becauſe they then by Paules preaching knew the holy ghoſt, neither muſt it be thought a contrarietie, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though afterwardes no mention is made of the holy ghoſt: yet it is beleeued, and that which is omitted in wordes is expreſſed in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21305:168"/>faith. For when it is ſaide, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by the vnity of the name is fullfilled the whole miſterie: neither is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt ſeparated from the baptiſme of Chriſt becauſe Iohn baptized to repentance, Chriſt in the holy ghoſt. Thus farre Ambroſe.</p>
               <p>Hierome, Tom. 6. in Ioel. ca. 2. pa. 66. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith he) the ſauing health of God, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee ſeene, except the holy ghoſt bee powred downe: and who ſo ſaith that he beleeueth in Chriſt, and beleeueth not in the holy ghoſt: he hath not the eyes of perfect faith. Whereon, alſo in the Actes of the Apoſtles: they which were baptized by Iohns baptiſme into him that was to come, that is, in the name of the Lord Ieſus: becauſe when Paule asked them, they aunſwered, wee know not whether there be an holy ghoſt: they were baptized againe: yea they receiued true baptiſme, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the holie ghoſt, and the miſterie of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, whatſoeuer is receiued in the name of the one or the other perſon, is vnperfect, &amp;c. Auguſtine cont. Petil. cap. 7. coll. 498. ſaieth. Paule baptized thoſe twelue, either becauſe they had not receiued Iohns baptiſme, but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: or elſe, if they had receiued it, yet they had not receiued Chriſts baptiſme. For he thought with Cyprian, and Tertullian, and other fathers that Iohns baptiſme and Chriſts did differ: of which matter more hereafter. Of our owne writers alſo, that learned man Wolff. Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, about the place of the Act. 19. thinketh as
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21305:169"/>Ambroſe doth, in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon place, the place of baptiſme, whoſe words, becauſe he ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dleth that place very largely, we wil not repeat, and before Muſculus, Bucer both on the third of Matth. and on the fourth of the epiſt. to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. vpon Math. he hath theſe words. To thoſe Epheſians, which had beene baptized with Iohns baptiſme, not knowing what it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as then they knewe not the holy gnoſt: wherewith Paule had preached that Chriſt ſhould baptize them; wee reade that he ſaid Act. 19. Iohn baptized indeed with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of repentance, ſaying vnto the people, that they ſhould beleeue in him, which ſhould come after him, that is, in Chriſt Ieſus. Nowe what do we elſe, or ought we to do in bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing? For ours is alſo the baptiſme of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſo long as thoſe whome we baptize, we alſo burie into the death of Chriſt, that is, we aſcribe them into that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all there life, muſt die vnto ſinne, and liue vnto righteouſneſſe: and yet ſhall not receiue that neither, but by the gift of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch as be of years of diſcretion, whom we baptize, we require their faith in Chriſt: &amp; the infants we commit vnto the church to be brought vp to the ſame faith. Therefore Paule would neuer haue rebaptized thoſe Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, if they had beene baptized with Iohns bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that is, with that baptiſme, wherewith he vſed to baptize, into repentance and the faith of Chriſt: but ſeing they were (as Luke
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21305:169"/>reporteth) onely baptized into Iohns bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which notwithſtanding they knew not what it was, and were altogether ignorant of the baptiſme of Chriſt, that is, of the ſpirit, he baptized them: ſhewing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what Iohns baptiſme was: and how he baptized into Chriſt not into his owne ſprinkling or dipping of the water, as though that could be any profite vnto them. He therefore baptized them with this baptiſme of Iohn, that is, as Iohn vſed to do, into the name of the Lord Ieſus: and by &amp; by after laying on his hands, he baptized the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the baptiſme alſo of Chriſt, that is, with the ſpirit. For immediatly the holy ghoſt came on them, as it is there read. This there.</p>
               <p>And vpon the epiſtle to the Epheſ. chap. 4. the ſame Bucer writeth thus. Hereby it is alſo manifeſt, that the twelue men at Epheſus, which knew not whether there were an holie ghoſt or no whome Paule baptized, were not baptized with the baptiſme of Iohn, that is, with that which he adminiſtred: but, as they witneſſed themſelues, they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iohns baptiſme. For Iohn preached vnto all whome hee baptized, that Chriſt ſhould baptize them with the holy ghoſt: and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that they would beleeue in him, and that of him they might receiue the holy ghoſt. And therefore theſe Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could not haue beene ignorant of the holy ghoſt, if they had bin waſhed with that baptiſme, which might truely be called Iohns: which alſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21305:170"/>words to thoſe men doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: Iohn verily baptized with the baptiſme of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, ſaying vnto the people, that they ſhould beleeue in him, which ſhould come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, that is, in Chriſt. For by theſe wordes he would teach vs, that they neuer receiued Iohns baptiſme, who as yet knew not Iohns preaching of Chriſt, and the promiſe. Thus farre Bucer.</p>
               <p>Seing then the fathers expound this place in Act. 19. as wee haue nowe declared: who I pray am I, that I ſhould dare, or that I ought to gaine-ſay, ſo many and ſo learned men, in ſuch an expoſition of this ſcripture, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any whitt wreſt the text, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth any other ſcriptures, nor is againſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of faith, nor bringeth with it any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities?</p>
               <p>For if any man ſhall obiect out of the text, that ſame <hi>truely</hi> and <hi>but:</hi> it prooueth nothing againſt the fathers expoſition: ſeing it is no vnuſuall thing with the Apoſtle, where hee ſaieth firſt <hi>truely,</hi> not alwaies to ioyne the aduerſatiue particle <hi>but:</hi> Rom. 3. ver. 2. Coll. 2. ver. 23. and in other places. And vnto this <hi>truely,</hi> another <hi>but,</hi> which Luke for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſake left out, might bee vnderſtood verie fittly, as hereafter we will ſhew: ſo that it is no neceſſitie, with this <hi>truely</hi> to ioyne that <hi>but,</hi> which followeth in the 5. verſe: in which verſe the fathers, will haue, not Paules ſpeach, but Lukes to be continued. Therefore the fathers
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21305:170"/>expoſition is not repugnant to the text: nor yet with any other ſcripture. For if any man ſay, Paule writeth to the Corinthians, that he is gladd he baptized none, but the houſe of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phana: it may be anſwered, it is true, namely at Corinth: but theſe twelue were baptized at Epheſus: and beſides, he ſpeaketh of ſuch as were baptized with his owne hand: but theſe twelue, he might baptiſe by ſome other: to diſpute no longer about the circumſtance of the time. And it is moſt certaine, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the analogie of faith, nor bringeth with it any abſurdities: becauſe the fathers do not ſpeake of a baptiſme rightly adminiſtred, as though Paule had repeated that again. This expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore of the fathers in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot eaſily be refelled. And this ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the chiefeſt cauſe why I haue euer thus thought, and yet thinke of this action of Paule: although indeed I cannot conſent vnto them all, in the cauſe, why Paule baptized them: but onely to Ambroſe and Hierome.</p>
               <p>That Iohns Baptiſme, &amp; Chriſts Baptiſme did differ, the fathers teach, both by this, that Iohn ſaide, how <hi>he baptized</hi> (onely) <hi>with vvater: but Chriſt ſhould baptize with the holy ghoſt, &amp; with fire:</hi> and alſo by this, that the baptiſme of Iohn is called, <hi>the baptiſme of repentance:</hi> but Chriſtes baptiſme is ſaid to <hi>bee giuen for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And becauſe that he prepared the waye to this: &amp; (as Tertull. ſpeaketh) that baptiſme of repentance, was as it were a ſueing for the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21305:171"/>remiſſion of ſinnes and ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt, which was to follow after. Read Tertul. of bap. pag. 707.</p>
               <p>So Cyprian alſo in his ſermon of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſt, and of the manifeſtation of the Trinitie, pag. 430. So Auguſt. To. 7. againſt. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. cap.</hi> 7. But all of vs doe not knowe, what the fathers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the baptiſme. For they ment not, that the one diffred from the other in the matter, or in the ſigne, or in the doctrine, and forme of baptiſine: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in efficacie: that namely, although remiſſion of ſinnes was giuen to them, which were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Iohns baptiſme: yet the ſame was not of Iohns baptiſme, that is, of water, but by the baptiſme of Chriſt, which is the baptiſme of the ſpirite: whereunto that belongeth: <hi>I baptize with water, but he with the holy ghoſt.</hi> And with this baptiſme of the ſpirit were they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized, which beleeued in Chriſt, whome Iohn ſaide was then come, though all knewe him not. Therefore Iohn in his baptiſme did inculcate and often repeate this faith, as Paule witneſſeth in that place of the 19 of the Actes. They therefore are deceiued, who for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, did thinke the baptiſme of water was to be repeated.</p>
               <p>Auguſt. againſt. <hi>Petil.</hi> (as we touched a little before) ſheweth how ſome held opinion, that the 12 did lye vnto the Apoſtle, when being asked vnto what they were baptized, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, vnto Iohns baptiſme. So by this, that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21305:171"/>firſt thoſe Epheſians ſaide vnto him, that they had not yet heard, whether there were, that is, whether that holy ghoſt did exiſt or not, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, the giuer of thoſe giftes, whereof the ſpeach was: the Apoſtle might be ſaid to conuince the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a lye, by this argument. Whoſoeuer haue bin baptized, they haue profeſſed faith in Chriſt, as the ſonne of God, and conſequently in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the ſpirite of them both. For Iohn did require this faith: &amp; according to the ſame he baptized men: and in baptizing he alwayes vrged that Ieſus Chriſt was he which ſhould baptize in the ſpirit. But you, by your owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, do not know this ſpirite &amp;c. and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not rightly in Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſurely, to ſaye that theſe twelue did lye vnto the church and to the Apoſtle: it ſeemes to me, to be to hard and vile a thing in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which profeſſed Chriſt. And for this cauſe we did euer better allow of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ambroſe &amp; Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome: that the 12 did ſay truely, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaid, they were baptized vnto Iohns baptiſme: but yet not by Iohn himſelfe, but by ſome one of Iohns diſciples, who expounded not vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true doctrine concerning God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptized them not rightlie. But all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe hold beyond all controuerſie, that they which are not rightly baptized into Ieſus Chriſt, as the naturall Sonne of God, &amp; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, and ſo alſo into his father, and the ſpirite of them both: the ſame muſt bee rightlie bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And therefore thoſe twelue were not, as
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21305:172"/>being not baptized, rebaptized: but, as being not rightlie baptized, Paule did baptize them with true baptiſme, firſt teaching them the true doctrine of the trinitie, which alſo Iohn had preached vnto them.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the authoritie of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: from whome, either in their aſſertions, or in their expoſitions of Scriptures, eſpeciallie where they all, for the moſt part doe agree, I dare not decline for my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſake, vnleſſe I be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained by moſt apparant reaſons. Thus I freelie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to the whole church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The reaſon alſo, (beſids the authoritie of the fathers) brought as we ſaw before, euen by the fathers, out of the verie text, confirmeth me in the ſame opinion. This reaſon is partly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of thoſe words, which theſe Epheſians, being asked by Paule, whether they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holie ghoſt, that is, the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt, aunſwered, ſaying: that they had not ſo much as heard, whether there bee, that is, whether that holie ghoſt bee exiſtent: whome Paule would haue to bee the author of thoſe gifts: ſo farre from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was, that they ſhould haue receiued him and his gifts: and partlie it is gathered out of the wordes, which Paule v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed concerning the doctrine and baptiſme of Iohn, ſaying, <hi>Iohn verily baptized with the baptiſme of repentance,</hi> ſaying vnto the people, that they ſhould beleeue in him, which ſhould come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, that is, in Chriſt Ieſus: as if he had ſaid, you haue not rightlie beleeued in Chriſt, ſuch as
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21305:172"/>he is, the ſonne of God, God: ſeing yee know not his ſpirite. The concluſion followed: that therefore they, although they were baptiſed, by I knowe not whome, into Iohns baptiſme, yet were not rightlie baptized: ſeing they were not inſtructed in the doctrin of the perſon of Chriſt, in whome they ought to beleeue, namelie, that he was not onelie man and the Meſſias, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſonne of God, God: from whome alſo &amp; from the father proceedeth the holie ghoſt, and conſequentlie not in the doctrine of god the father, the ſonne, and the holie ghoſt, in the name of all which, baptiſme is to be giuen. And therefore that they ought to learne the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning the father, ſonne, and holie ghoſt, and reſting therein, to receiue lawfull baptiſme: that afterwardes by laying on of hands, they might receiue the gifts of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirite: which Luke teacheth to bee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes done, ſaying, <hi>but vvhen they heard it,</hi> (namely, thoſe twelue Epheſians:) what whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard? euen, when they perceiued Paules doctrine, concerning true faith in Chriſt the ſonne of God, and ſo in his father, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt: which faith Iohn had alſo preached, and wherein they reſting were baptized &amp;c. This is the interpretation of the fathers: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that thoſe twelue were not rightlie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the doctrin of god the father, the ſonne &amp; holie ghoſt, and ſo neither rightlie baptized: and it may be confirmed, both by the kindred and cuntrie of thoſe twelue: and alſo by the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21305:173"/>cauſe, for which Paule, letting alone al the reſt, peculiarly asked them, whether they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holie ghoſt, ſince they beleeued.</p>
               <p>By kinde they were Iewes, as appeareth by Iohns baptiſme, vnto which they ſaide they were baptized: and they were baptized by a Iewe. But the Iewes for the moſt part, neuer rightlie held the doctrine of the three perſons ſubſiſting in one eſſence. And therefore theſe 12 Iewes alſo, though they graunted Ieſus, to bee the true Meſſias: yet they ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge but onely two perſons: the perſon of God the father, and the perſon of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, euen (as the moſt thought) a bare ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet ſuch a one, as in whome God the father dwelt: but that they were altogether ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the holie ghoſt was an exiſting thing, &amp; the giuer of thoſe graces, they are conuinced by their owne words.</p>
               <p>But ſurely there was ſome cauſe, why Paule comming into Epheſus, where were manie of Chriſts diſciples, asked this queſtion of the 12 Iewes onely. Surelie it is to bee thought, by their aunſwer, that the Apoſtle, either by their owne talke, or by telling of ſome other of the brethren, perceiued that theſe twelue did not thinke aright concerning the holie ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Finallie this was the Apoſtles argument, whereby he would prooue by their owne au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that they were not baptized with the true baptiſme of Iohn.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer hath bin baptized with the true
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21305:173"/>baptiſme of Iohn: he hath alſo heard his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning god the father, the ſonne, &amp; the holy ghoſt: and hath profeſſed the ſame, and conſequently hath knowne alſo the holy ghoſt. This propoſition is not expreſſed: but the proofe of it, the Apoſtle bringeth in the 4. verſe, ſaying, Iohn baptized &amp;c. that is, Iohn preached not onely repentance, but alſo faith in Chriſt: namely, that he is not onely man the Meſſias, but alſo the ſonne of God, God: from whome, as alſo from the father, proceedeth the holie ghoſt, and that hee ſhall baptize in the holie ghoſt: and therefore all which deſire to bee ſaued, muſt alſo beleeue in him, as the true Sauiour.</p>
               <p>But you haue not heard this doctrine, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it, &amp; therfore haue not truely beleeued in Chriſt, ſuch as he is. For yee your ſelues ſay, yee haue not ſo much as heard whether there bee an holie ghoſt, (namelie, when yee were baptized). Therefore &amp;c. So conſequentlie it remaineth, that profeſſing this doctrine and faith, yee nowe receiue lawfull baptiſme: and afterward by the laying on of handes thoſe giftes of the holie ghoſt. This is the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the argument according to the expoſition of the fathers: but Luke, as the Prophets and Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts vſe to doe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended the whole ſumme in few words.</p>
               <p>And I praye, what abſurditie can followe hereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or what iniurie is done to the Apoſtles narration? is the hereſie of the Donatiftes &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21305:174"/>maintained? nothing leſſe. For they rebaptize ſuch as are rightlie baptized: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle baptizeth them, which had not beene rightly baptized: as hauing not heard nor pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſed the true doctrine concerning God, he tooke care they ſhould be rightlie baptized. And ſuch when they come into the catholicke church, (we ſpeake of them that bee of yeares of diſcretion) all the fathers teach, they muſt be baptized with true baptiſme, inſtructing them firſt in the doctrine concerning God, &amp; Chriſt their Sauiour:</p>
               <p>Touching the text it ſelfe: it is no whitt wreſted. That their aunſwer. <hi>(But wee haue not ſo much as heard whether there be an holie ghoſt)</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not bee vnderſtood of the giftes of the holie ghoſt, it appeareth by Paules demaund fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being asked with an admiration: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what were yee then baptized?</hi> For no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized vnto the giftes of the holie ghoſt: but vnto the holie ghoſt it ſelfe, as alſo vnto the father, and the ſonne. And the Apoſtles held it for certaine, beyond all doubt, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer were baptized either of Iohn, &amp; his true diſciples, or of Chriſts diſciples: they were ſurelie baptized, with inſtruction of the true doctrine of the holie ghoſt alſo, according to Chriſts inſtitution. Hereupon was that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what were ye then baptized?</hi> They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, <hi>vnto Iohns baptiſme:</hi> For Paule thought this could not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together that they ſhould bee baptized with Iohns lawfull bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21305:174"/>and yet ſhould not knowe nay not ſo much as heare, whether there were, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there did exiſt an holie ghoſt: whom Iohn both knewe and preached vnto all that came to his baptiſme: neither did he preach Chriſt without this holie ghoſt. For he ſaid that he <hi>baptized in water, but Chriſt Ieſus ſhould baptize in the holie ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon was it, that meaning to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince them, that they were not baptized of Iohn, nor of his true diſciples, he added, ſaying: <hi>Iohn indeed &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>truely</hi> or <hi>verely</hi> is an aduerſatiue particle: wherby he would ſhew, how it could not agree with the lawfull baptiſme of Iohn, that they ſaid, they had not ſo much as heard (namelie when they were baptized) whether there be an holie ghoſt or no: Sith Iohn bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized none, without mentioning the ſame. And to this <hi>truely</hi> here expreſſed, doeth a <hi>but</hi> cloſelie vnderſtood make aunſwer: ſo that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſuch, as before we ſet downe. <hi>Iohn indeed baptized &amp;c:</hi> as though he had ſaid: Iohn preached both repentance, and faith in Ieſus Chriſt, ſuch as he is, namely the ſonne of god, from whome as alſo from the father procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the holy ghoſt, and who baptizeth in the holie ghoſt, and into the confeſſion of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he baptizeth men. The minor was to be added, which Luke expreſſed not, becauſe it is contained in the twelues owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>but vvee haue not ſo much as heard &amp;c.</hi> what is plainer then this text?</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:21305:175"/>
               <p>That therefore which followeth in the fift verſe, <hi>But when they heard it &amp;c,</hi> is Lukes owne words, ſhewing truelie and brieflie, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpon Paules argumentation: <hi>But when they heard &amp;c,</hi> (namely theſe 12) <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard,</hi> what? what it is truelie to beleeue in Chriſt, &amp; that he baptized men, according to the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this doctrine concerning Chriſt, &amp; his father, and the holie ghoſt: and that Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as the onely Sauiour, baptized men into the holie ghoſt: when they heard (I ſaye) theſe things, not onely with the eares of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but alſo of their mindes: and ſo beleeued and confeſſed the ſame: <hi>They vvere baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> that is, into Ieſus, as he is called and deſcribed in the Scriptures, not onelie man, but alſo the ſonne of God, God: from whome, as alſo from the father procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the holie ghoſt: and therefore, as a true and onelie Sauiour baptizeth vs with his holy ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Add this alſo, that by the new interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is admitted in a little narration, no ſmale Battologie or ſuperfluitie of words. For when Paule ſaid, <hi>Iohn verily baptized vvith the baptiſme of repentance, ſaying vnto the people that they ſhould beleeue in him, which ſhould come after him, that is, in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> to what ende ſhould the Apoſtles haue added this concerning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom Iohn baptized, <hi>but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that companie or thoſe men, were baptized. For who could not vnderſtand, by the wordes
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:21305:175"/>going before, if Iohn baptized: they therefore, which had heard &amp; profeſſed his doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning repentance, and faith in Chriſt, were by Iohn baptized.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if I ſhould allow that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, I ſee not, what Paule could els proue by this whole narration, but that thoſe Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had beene rightlie baptized: and therefore that nothing elſe remained, but that by laying on of hands, they might receiue the holy ghoſt. But this concluſion, I doe not thinke to agree with that which goeth before it, but to bee needeleſſe.</p>
               <p>I haue to my power, declared the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fathers, vpon this place, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtlie, and without preiudice to anie: to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but that I may by ſuch reaſons as I am able declare vnto the brethren, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps haue tooke offence at that particle in my confeſſion, <hi>That Paule did baptize thoſe twelue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vvhich had not bin rightly baptized:</hi> that I did not put thoſe words raſhlie in my confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By the way as I ſaid, we condemne no other mens interpretation.</p>
               <p>And this alſo I freely profeſſe, that my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſuch, that I cannot be eaſily drawne to diſſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auncient fathers, either in their aſſertions, or in their interpretations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Vnleſſe I be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced &amp; enforced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt teſtimonies of holy ſcriptures, by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequences &amp; plaine demonſtrations. For ſo doeth my conſcience reſt, and in this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:21305:176"/>ſetled ſtay of minde I deſire to die.</p>
               <p>And therefore I humbly deſire of all the brethren, that if in this behalfe, my opinion, be not altogeather as theirs is: they will by no meanes take offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: eſpecially, ſeeing that in all the principall points of Chriſtian faith: we haue a ſound agreement.</p>

               <p>The place of the 1. to the Corinth. 6. beeing diligently marked (as alſo we noted before in the 15. chap. and 14.

               <p>We ſay, that hypocrites doe not eate the tru body of Chriſt, ſith they are void of faith (name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly they eare it not truely and indeede, ſith it is not indeede eaten, but onely by true faith, which they want) but onely ſacramentally, that is, they eate indeede the ſacrament, and the ſigne it felfe: The Adverſaries ſay alſo, that hypocrites doe eate the true body of Chriſt, onely ſacramentally: but by this word they meane, that they receiue not onely the ſacrament, that is, the ſigne, but all the thing it ſelfe: though not vnto ſalvation. If they mean this in the ſame ſence, that the Apoſtle doth, when he ſaid, <hi>The Corinthians were all ſanctified, iuſtified &amp;c.</hi> namely that by receiuing baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the ſacrament of true Regeneration, and ſanctification, they were reckoned to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the thing alſo: ſith the very ſacrament
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:21305:176"/>hindred not, but they might alſo be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the true ſanctification, although all of them did not indeede obtaine the ſame, by reaſon of their hypocriticall faith; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I ſee not, but ſuch a manner of ſpeaking may be well allowed: ſo it be declared as it ought, after the Apoſtles meaning. This I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleadge, that the brethren may bethinke them of ſome good meanes of agreement, that ſo great an offence and ſcandale may be rooted out of the Church.

               <p>Here ſhould a ſubdiſtinction haue beene added of the godly: becauſe ſome doe come worthely, ſome vnworthely: yea one and the ſame godly man eateth ſometime worthily ſometime not worthily enough, as in the 1. to the Corinth. 11. it appeareth.

               <p>There be two kindes of men, which, like as they come to the hearing of the word, ſo may they come to receiue the ſupper of the Lord: the vngodly, and the godly.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed: as Atheiſts, Godleſſe men, alſo Iewes and Turkes, and all ſuch as knowe nothing, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21305:177"/>beleeue nothing of all thoſe thinges, which they heare by the preaching of the goſpell, or ſee to bee done by the adminiſtration of the Sacraments: nay they rather laugh at and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all ſuch matters. Theſe if they come to the Lords table: they neither eate nor drinke anie thing elſe, but bread and wine, and that alſo, not as they are ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, (for they know not of what thinges they are ſacraments) but onely as they are of their owne nature, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, bread &amp; wine. For euen ſo alſo at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpell, they receiue nothing but bare words and the ſound of the words. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort are indeed and before God wicked, though they are not ſo in reſpect, I meane, in profeſſion, or in ſight of men: ſuch as are the hypocrites in the church: who are not indued with the true and liuelie faith, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the elect: but haue onely a temporall and an hypocriticall beleefe. Theſe, comming to the ſupper, doe indeed eate and drinke no more then the former: that is, bread &amp; wine. The reaſon is, becauſe they haue no true faith, by which alone, Chriſts body is truely eaten. For all this the difference betweene theſe and the other is not little.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For the former, ſeing they beleeue none of all the things which they heare concerning Chriſts bodie in the ſupper: nor perceiue anie thing with their mindes: as little do they eate the true bodie of Chriſt: but onely with the mouth of the bodie they eate bread, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21305:177"/>bread. But the other, ſeing that by their onely hiſtoricall, hypocriticall and temporall beleefe, they vnderſtand in their minde, and in ſome ſort, doe beleeue the things which are ſpoken and done: therefore by the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and minde, they may bee ſaide in ſome ſort to receiue, and in ſome ſorte to taſte, the bodie of Chriſt offred in the word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: although they doe not in verie deede eate it, ſeing they do not ſwallow nor retaine the ſame (for this properlie is to eate) in the ſtomacke of their ſoule for nouriſhment of their ſpirite: but rather do ſpue or vomitt out the ſame, being taſted, and after a ſorte recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued downe. For ſo alſo we read in the 6 to the Heb. of thoſe temporary profeſſors: that they taſted the heauenlie gifte and good word of God: as if he had ſaid, they taſted indeed, and that alſo by the gift of the holie ghoſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſted, they caſt it vp againe. And in the parable of the ſeede: the temporary ones were ſaid to receiue the ſeede of the word: but that they kept it not, and therefore brought forth no fruite by it. Theſe things cannot be ſaid of the firſt ſort of theſe wicked ones, which are moſt true of the ſecond ſort, namelie, theſe temporarie hypocrites. Let this then bee the firſt difference: hereuppon followes another difference betweene the eating of thoſe and theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They, ſeing the bread which they take into their mouthes, they nether acknowledge
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21305:178"/>nor beleeue it to bee a Sacrament of Chriſts bodie: therefore they take it and eate it, not as a Sacrament, but as common bread: and therefore can they not be ſaid to eate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt ſacramentallie. But theſe take the bread, not as common bread, but as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts bodie: and for that cauſe, are ſaid to eate Chriſts bodie, though not in verie deede, ſeing they lack the mouth and teeth of true faith, yet to eate it ſacramentallie: by an argument drawne, as they call it, <hi>à coniugatis:</hi> they eate the Sacrament, as the Sacrament of Chriſts bodie: therefore they eate Chriſts body ſacramentally: and ſo farre forth as it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe they eate not Chriſts bodie in verie deed, but onely the Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Hereupon followeth that expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpake before, that it is not vngodlie to ſay ſimply and abſolutely, that the hypocrites do eate not onelie the Sacrament, but alſo the thing of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is, not onely bread, but alſo the verie bodie of Chriſt. But in what ſenſe? namelie, in that, wherein the Apoſtle ſaid, all they of Corinth in their firſt ſtate <hi>were vncleane, vngodlie, &amp;c:</hi> afterwards he ſaid, they <hi>were not onely vvaſhed</hi> (which ſome might haue interpreted onelie of the water of baptiſme) <hi>but alſo ſanctified. and iuſtified:</hi> when notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were not all made truelie ſuch: but as yet there lacked not ſome hypocrits amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:21305:178"/>
               <p>So all they which profeſſing faith in Chriſt doe come to his ſupper, and eate the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lotds bodie, are ſaide alſo to eate the Lords true bodie, by reaſon of the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vnion, which cauſeth, that he which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſigne, is by the church iudged to haue receiued alſo the thing ſignified. becauſe there is no fault either in the inſtitutor, of the Sacrament, or in the Sacrament it ſelfe, but that he which hath receiued &amp; eaten the one, might haue alſo receiued and eaten the other: ſith Chriſt by the miniſter doeth truelie offer them both: and the ſoundnes and trueth of the Sacrament, dependeth not vppon our faith, but vppon Chriſts inſtitution, So that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the whole Sacrament, but onely the ſigne without the thing ſignified the fault is in our owne ſelues, who receiue one part with the mouth of our bodie, and caſt away the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part by our infidelitie (for an hypocritical faith is infidelitie:) ſeparating thoſe thinges which God would haue to be ioyned. By theſe thinges it appeareth, what difference is in the eating of thoſe that are ſimplie wicked, &amp; the hypocrites: although neither ſort can bee ſaid truely to eate Chriſts true bodie. For ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do truely eate Chriſt, who are alſo truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt, by a true and liuelie faith: with which alone, the elect are indued. They which are dead corporallie, can no longer eate corporall meate: how then ſhould they which are dead ſpirituallie, bee fedd with ſpirituall
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:21305:179"/>foode? And onelie the faithfull, doe therefore liue, becauſe by a liuelie faith, they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto Chriſt, which is our life, as members to their head: as braunches to the vine, as the boughes to their tree. And if, as Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſaieth, <hi>it be meate of the minde, not of the bellie: ſurely it is eaten vvith the teeth not of the bodie, but of a faithfull minde:</hi> which onely the godlie can doe.</p>
               <p>If likewiſe the bodie of Chriſt be (as Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſpeaketh) <hi>a heauenlie matter:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owe can it bee eaten of them, which haue nothing in them that is heauely, but are altogether earthly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; indued with no faith, whereby they may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp into heauen, and eate the heauenlie foode? therefore onely the godlie can do this.</p>
               <p>But the faithfull alſo are not affected all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or after one ſort: ſeing verie ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eate worthelie, but ſometime it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, that they eate vnworthelie: and therefore are ſundrie wayes chaſtened by God for it.</p>
               <p>They are ſaide to eate worthelie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they eate of the Lords bread, doe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelues, whether they be in faith: &amp; if they be, then they diligentlie waye and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſignification and greatnes of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: moreouer they trye their conſciences, whether they bee touched with a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and by earneſt &amp; hartie prayers do ſtirre themſelues vp to both.</p>
               <p>And they eate vnworthilie, who although they be planted in Chriſt, by faith and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:21305:179"/>of regeneration: yet their faith being in ſome ſorte choaked with the cares of this world, &amp; other affections of the fleſh: doe nor ſufficientlie proue themſelues: do not dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie examine, nor ſtirr vp themſelues, to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conſideration of ſo great a miſterie: nor weigh with an attentiue minde, what is giuen in that holie table; what the Lord requireth of them; for whome, and for what purpoſe the Supper was inſtituted by the Lord: Laſtlie, they do eate vnworthelie, who as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>diſcorne not the Lords bodie:</hi> and ſo come not to that table, with a due reuerence, &amp; feare of the Lord: diſcerning in their minde and by faith, the thinges ſignified, from the ſignes, and the ſignes from other common meates and drinkes, in ſuch ſufficient manner as they ought: whereby they doe not aſwell open the mouth of the inward man, to eate the ſpirituall foode; as they doe the mouth of the outward man, to eate the foode, which (of it owne nature) is corporall. By reaſon of this duetie ſo neglected, namelie, that they do not ſufficientlie prooue themſelues, nor diſcerne or iudge of the Lords bodie, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie do eate vnworthilie the Lords bread, chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and faithfull men other whiles are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be viſited with diuers chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, yet ſuch as are for their ſaluation, leaſt they ſhould be condemned in this world.

               <p>Whereunto belongeth alſo, that others doe teach, how faith is an aſſured knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and Chriſt, conceaued by the word of God &amp;c.

               <p>Whereas I ſo expounded that place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the faith of Abraham out of the 15 of Geneſis, and the 4. to the Rom. as I ſaide, that that ſame thing was imputed vnto him for righteouſnes, which hee beleeued concerning Chriſt the promiſed ſeede: I did it rather reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the matter it ſelfe, then the bare word of faith. For I was not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Paule ſpake of the faith of Abraham, that this (faith) was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: ſeing the Apoſtle manifeſtly gathering a general doctrine from the example of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, adioyneth theſe wordes: <hi>But to him that vvorketh not, but beleeueth in him that inſtifieth the vngodlie, his faith is counted for righteouſnes:</hi> that is, hee is therefore accompted iuſt with God: becauſe he beleeueth in him which iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth the vngodlie: by which place it moſt

               <p>But when the queſtion is asked, what cauſe there is, why iuſtification ſhould be attributed to faith, and not to the works thereof: it is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be aunſwered, and that both well and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe faith &amp; not the works thereof, doth apprehend remiſſion of ſinnes, and Chriſt our righteouſnes. For by it we are not iuſtified in reſpect that it is a worke, but in reſpect that Chriſt is apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by it: by the righteouſnes of whom alone, being imputed vnto vs, we are properlie reputed iuſt before God: and this is that which ſome ſay, how faith iuſtifieth not in reſpect of it ſelfe, but in reſpect of the obiect, which it taketh hold on. Thus is it manifeſt, that it is true which I ſaide, how that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie imputed vnto Abraham for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for that hee beleeued God concerning Chriſt, namelie that in him all nations ſhould be bleſſed: and therefore Abraham himſelfe alſo.</p>

For I beleeue, that the thinges which were decreed and receiued of the fathers, by common conſent of them all gathered together in the name of the Lord, without anie contradiction of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that they alſo (though they bee not of equall authoritie with the Scriptures) come from the holie ghoſt. Hereupon it is, that the thinges which are of this ſorte, I neither will nor dare diſprooue, with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And what is more certaine, out of the hiſtories, the councells, and writings of all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21305:183"/>the fathers: then that thoſe orders of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of which wee ſpake, were ordained and receiued in the church, by common conſent of all the whole chriſtian common wealth?

               <p>For confirmation ſake hereof: I haue thought good here to inſert, that which Martin Bucer of godlie memorie, a man both for life and learning moſt famous, hath left written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe matters vpon the Epiſtle to the Epheſians.</p>
               <p>The miniſterie of the worde, being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by reading and rehearſing the diuine Scriptures, by interpretation and expoſition of the ſame, and with exhortations take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there out, and alſo by rehearſall and catechiſme, which is done by mutuall queſtions and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the yong beginner and the catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer: and alſo by holie conferences, and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the hard queſtions about religion: according to this manifold diſpenſation of wholeſome doctrine, there are alſo manie dueties in this function.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21305:184"/>to the perfecteſt manner of teaching, is with an eſpeciall care to bee vſed in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the doctrine of ſaluation: becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ought to be deliuered as a knowledge both of all other moſt diuine, and of all, moſt difficult: namelie, that <hi>he which is man, ſhould liue according to God.</hi> Now they which do teach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the artes, as they are contained in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten knowne books: as, if they meane to teach mathematicall principles out of Euclide: firſt of all they will reade and rehearſe the ſame booke: by and by, they will expound the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall words, ſuch as euerie one knowes not, as euerie art hath it owne proper wordes and names. Then if there be any collection or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation darke or intricate, they explaine the ſame by Analyſis or reſolution, and ſet it forth by examples: and by generall precepts they teach particular things, and declare how largelie the ſame are ment and taken. And this is properlie to teach. Now though this bee in faithfull and ſound deliuerie of inſtruction, yet a true &amp; faithfull teacher, not contenting himſelfe thus, doth alſo rehearſe and often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth accompt of that which he teacheth: and is ſtill at hand among his ſchollers, that of ſuch things as they doubt, they may euer require and aske the plainer expoſition of himſelfe. Moreouer the thinges which he hath taught them, he alſo propoundeth to be decided and handled in publike diſputations, that no whit
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21305:184"/>of doubt may remaine. To theſe thinges alſo, he adioyneth oftentimes exhortations, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them forward in the ſame inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and exhortations from ſuch matters as may hinder the ſame, and alſo generall admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reprehenſions, and childings. Laſtlie, ſuch a maiſter marketh diligentlie, what profite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of his ſchollers taketh: &amp; if he finde anie one to loyter in his learning, he both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatelie corrects him, and admoniſheth him of his duetie: if he perceiue anie to goe through his learning luſtilie, him he encourageth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth, and whetteth on to follow the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of it more &amp; more.
<note place="margin">From the ſeuen due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching were brought into the church 7. orders of miniſters.</note> All theſe ſeuen points of teaching, did our Lord Chriſt alſo obſerue. In the Synagoge at Nazareth he read the 61. chapter of Eſay and expounded it, Luc. 4. He expounded the commaundements of God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the mount, Math. 5. And he taught in all places: and exhorted: he reprehended, out of the word of God. And he made aunſwer to al that asked him, aſwell good as badd: and alſo asked them, as Matt. 22. He alſo catechized his diſciples: and he himſelfe was preſent at a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, Luc. 2.</p>
               <p>Sith then the miniſterie of teaching doth require ſuch manifold labour: there haue bin alſo many ſorts or orders of miniſters appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this miniſterie. And firſt of all readers, whoſe office was in ſome pulpit or high place, to rehearſe the diuine ſcriptures. Now this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall of the ſcriptures was inſtituted to this
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:21305:185"/>ende, that the language and manner of phraſe, in the ſcripture, and the ſcripture it ſelfe alſo might ſo bee made better knowne and more familiar to the people. For within one yeare they reade ouer all the bible to the people: where as they which ſhall expound the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are not able to performe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome one parte, and that not greatnether, in one yeares ſpace. And meane while by the onely reading of the holie Bible to the people, the knowledge of all the principles of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfullie confirmed: for the ſame are ſtill againe and againe repeated in each of the holie books, and are declared by other &amp; other words, ſo that the people might often, by the following readings, learne that which by the former they could not ſo wel conceiue: And by this verie meanes the peoples iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſtrengthened, aſwell in religion, as alſo in the expoſitions of ſcriptures, and in all doctrine, which was brought vnto them either by the lawfull curats &amp; teachers of the church, or by others. For this cauſe this office of onely reading the Scriptures to the people, was greatly eſteemed in the auncient churches: neither were any choſen for this miniſterie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for ſingular piety. Which we may knowe aſwell by other monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the auncient fathers, as eſpecially by two epiſtles of Saint Cyprian, as the fiue Epiſt. of Aurelius the reader ordained, &amp; the 5 &amp; 3. Epiſt. booke 2. of Saturus, and in the 4. booke
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21305:185"/>of Celerinus, Celeſtinus. To theſe readers were afterwardes alſo added queriſters or ſinging men, which ordered and directed the ſinging of the pſalmes and hymnes. For the reading of the holie Scriptures, it is, by Gods grace, verie well appointed in the churches of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: if ſo bee that there were meete men ordained, which might add a grauitie and a religion worthy the diuine miniſterie in the holie readings. Let them therefore diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie weigh &amp; conſider whoſe mouth they make themſelues, which read the holie books vnto the people in their ſacred aſſemblies: euen the mouth of the Lord Almightie: as alſo of what force, and of what dignitie the words at which are read, which be the words and precepts of eternall life: Laſtlie, vnto what manner of men: and for what purpoſe the readers of the diuine Scriptures ought to ſerue. For they ſerue to adminiſter the worde euen to the children of God; for whoſe ſaluation the firſt begotten ſonne of God powred out his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood: and to whome, by them, the ſame ſaluation is more and more declared &amp; made perfect. All which things, whoſoeuer weigheth with himſelfe in true faith, what grauitie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, religiouſnes, can be vſed in any action, which ſuch a reader may ouerſlipp? And this they, whoſoeuer be appointed for that office, ought euermore to haue in the ſight of their minde: that the things which are read, muſt ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectually ſerue for the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith in the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:21305:186"/>hearers: which is then done, when the ſame things are well vnderſtood and receiued as the very words of god. To both which is requiſite, a pronunciation, verie plaine, diſcreet, graue, and religious. Hereby it is knowne, that they are not Chriſts miniſters, who do ſo read the holie Scriptures, as if onely this were to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that as little tarrying as may be, might be made in rehearſing the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now another duetie is, the interpretation of the doctrine which is to be diſpoſed, namly, a more plaine declaration of the wordes, and ſentences. This office was performed by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Elders: and ſometime by them of the order of Deacons and ſubdeacons: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo they employed vnto this function ſome of the laitie, whom they found by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt to be made fitt for the profitable exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the ſame. So Origen alſo a lay man, was called vnto this office in the church at Cęſarea in Paleſtine, by Alexander biſhop of Hieruſalem, &amp; by Theoctiſt biſhop of the ſame church at Caeſarea. So Euelpis was called by Neonus biſhop of Larandi: and Paulinus, by Celſus biſhop of Iconium, and Theodorus of Atticus, biſhop of Sinadi. This we read in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius his ſixt booke of his eccleſiaſticall ſtorie chap. 20: and out of the epiſtle of thoſe two biſhops, Alexander of Hieruſalem, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>octiſt of Caeſarea in Paleſtine, vnto Demetrius biſhop of Alexandria, who had reprehended the deed of theſe two biſhops concerning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:21305:186"/>as a thing neuer heard of, that a lay man where biſhops were preſent, ſhould ſpeake to the people in the congregation. But this the ſame biſhops manifeſtly affirmed, was not true but that godlie biſhopps had euer vſed, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort ſuch as they knewe meet men among the laitie, to profite the people by interpreting the Scriptures and by teaching, to execute this duetie, euen when themſelues were preſent.

In the ſame manner alſo the Biſhopps and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders did execute the fourth part of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the doctrine, which is, out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures expounded to make exhortations to the dueties of piety, and dehortations from ſinne, and from al things which might neuer ſo little hinder and ſtopp the courſe of a godlie and holie life: to reprehend them which ſinned, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort the penitent: this function was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performed by the biſhops and elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe irrequireth an eſpecial authority, 1. Tim. 5. The fift part, Catechizings they committed to Elders, or Deacons, or ſometimes to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of inferior orders, euen as euery one, was thought moſt fitt for that kinde of teaching. So Origen was alſo a Catechiſt at Alexandria,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:21305:187"/>as wee may reade in the ſixt booke of Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius his ſtorie of the church chapter thirteene and twentie. The ſixt parte alſo, the holie diſputations, they appointed to thoſe that ſeemed meeteſt: albeit for the moſt part the biſhops themſelues ordered the ſame. The ſeuenth parte, priuate conference, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, the biſhops alſo themſelues had a ſpeciall care to looke vnto: and alſo euermore exhorted the elders, and the grauer ſort of the inferior orders to do the ſame 1. Theſſ. 5. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this miniſterie muſt be executed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in rehearſing the holie Scriptures: and by biſhops in expounding and teaching, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, diſputing, &amp; priuate conferring: as alſo in reading and catechizing, if there bee not particular readers and catechiſts. But the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizings they committed to certaine elders and deacons, or ſome ſpecially choſen for that purpoſe, out of the inferior orders: like as they did alſo imploye in theſe dueties of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, teaching, &amp; diſputing, whomſoeuer they found meete for the ſame, in any order of the miniſterie, and alſo in the laitie as wee ſaide. And this was diligentlie marked and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in them all: that the holie ghoſt did ſo impart theſe giftes of teaching among men, that to one hee giueth a gifte and a ſingular facultie to interpret the holie Scriptures, and explane the ſame, to whome notwithſtanding hee giueth not the gift ſo readilie and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to teach and confirme the principles and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21305:187"/>grounds of our opinions out of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or to defend the ſame by diſputation. To another alſo hee giueth a peculiar and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table skill to make exhortations out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture, or admonitions, or reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: alſo to cathezice: and to inſtruct priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: to whome notwithſtanding, are not giuen the other partes of teaching. This varietie and diuerſitie of the giftes of the holie ghoſt wee haue dailie experience of in thoſe, which teach publikelie the people of Ieſus Chriſt, which are the true churches of Chriſt, and doe ſuffer themſelues to bee whollie gouerned by the holie ghoſt: Such doe religiouſlie obſerue what ſpirituall giftes are giuen to each one in the church: and do imploye euerie one in his owne function according to the ſame giftes ſo much as in them lieth. Wherefore to all the pointes of teaching, they appoint ſeuerall miniſters, if among their owne they finde ſuch as bee ſingularlie quallified and furniſhed by the Lord to euerie ſeuerall parte of teaching. But becauſe it is requiſite for the ſaluation of Gods people, that not anie church ſhould omittanie of theſe ſeuen partes of teaching, which I haue reckened: Euerie one of the miniſters, and laye-men alſo in what place ſoeuer of the church hee bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ought ſo farre forth as hee is able, to performe all theſe partes of teaching: both reading, interpreting, teaching, exhorting, catechizing, diſputing, and, priuate confening.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:21305:188"/>For each one muſt take vnto himſelfe in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring theſe dueties, ſo much of each one of them, as he findeth himſelfe furniſhed &amp; made fitt for by the holie ghoſt. Let vs weigh &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the example of a houſhold well ſorted &amp; ordered, in which the maiſter or husband exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth ſome dueties, the houſwife or matron, other dueties: the ſonnes other, &amp; the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters other: the menſeruants other, and the maideſeruants other: Here while they be all at home and in health, euerie one fulfilleth his owne duetie: but if anie of the familie be from home or bee ſicke, yet (if the neceſſitie of that ſeruice ſo vrgeth) they muſt all needs ſupplie that want, ſo that oftentimes the men muſt diſcharge womens duties, and women mens, the maiſters their ſeruants, and ſeruants their maiſters.</p>

               <p>The third part of clergie diſcipline is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſubiection, wherein clerks and miniſters of inferior degrees do ſubiect themſelues to them which are in the ſuperior orders &amp; miniſterie. This part of diſcipline the Lord taught vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his owne example: who ordained his diſciples to be teachers of gods choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through out the whole world, giuing them a certaine gouernement or domeſticall diſcipline, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar for this office: whome the Apoſtles imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, had alſo euerie one his diſciples, whome he inſtructed to the right performance of that holie miniſterie.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:21305:188"/>
               <p>For euerie difficult and hard courſe of life, requireth alſo a peculiar &amp; perpetual teaching, inſtruction, and watchfulneſſe ouer it: as wee ſee in the ſtudies of philoſophie, &amp; in military diſcipline. Which Lycurgus conſidering, ſo inſtituted (as Xenophon reporteth) the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth of the Lacaedemonians: that there ſhould not be one ſort or order in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, but ſhould haue a gouernement in it. Alſo Plato in his lawes and common wealth requireth that among citizens there ſhould be nothing without gard. Hereuppon our Lord alſo, deſirous that all that be his, ſhould ſo bee ſetled and agree together, as the members in a bodie are ſetled and knitt one to another: doth make euery one of his to be in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto others by whome they may bee maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, mooued and gouerned, as by members hauing a more large &amp; ample power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie then others haue. The ſame is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy ghoſt, <hi>Be ſubiect one to another in the feare of God,</hi> Eph. 5.</p>
               <p>The holy fathers therefore in times paſt thus conſidering theſe matters, ſo appointed this order in the clergy, that al the reſt of the clerks ſhould be maintained and guided of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterie or Elders with ſingular care &amp; diligence. And that among the Elders, the biſhop, as a conſull among the Senators of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, ſhould beare the chiefeſt care and gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce both of the whole church, and alſo peculiarly of the whole order of the cleargie. And in all
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:21305:189"/>the greateſt and moſt populous congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they ordained biſhops, and to each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations, which were in little townes &amp; villages, &amp; decreed that the elders &amp; curats of thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations whom they called <hi>Chorepiſcopi:</hi> cuntrie or pettie-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſhould euery one harken &amp; obey the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop &amp; presbitery next vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe thoſe ſuperior biſhops did call together, &amp; all their whole clergie, and did inſtruct them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the diligent execution of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But whereas it was the Lords will, that his people ſhould mutuallie loue among them ſelues, and ſhould mutually care one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen as farre and wide as might be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (for all chriſtians are one bodie:) the holie fathers ordained that the biſhops of each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince (for then all the romaine iuriſdictions were diſtributed into prouinces) ſhould meet together with their presbiteries, ſo often as the neceſſitie of the churches required: but alwaies twiſe in the yeare, and there they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning Chriſts doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, howe the ſame was adminiſtred, and how it proſpered in the churches: that where they found anie default, they might correct it: that which they knew to be well, they might confirme and ſet forward. And that theſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods might alſo bee ordered aright and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, they would haue the Metropolitaine, the biſhops of euery mother cittie, to be the chiefe directors, to call them together and to guide
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:21305:189"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For in each prouince, the head citty, wherin was the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion or ſeat of the chiefe gouernor, was called Metropolis, or the mother cittie. And therfore they inioyned vnto theſe Metro. politaine biſhops a certen care &amp; charge ouer al the churches throughout their prouince: that if they ſhould vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of any thing taught or done amiſſe either of the miniſters of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, that they ſhould giue warning therof in time: &amp; if by their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they could not ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſame, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the correction therof they ſhould call a Synode of biſhops: for it was not graunted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould execute any iudgement vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne authority, ouer churches which had bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of their owne: for the power of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouer both clergie &amp; laity, was only in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the biſhop &amp; elder of the ſame place. And the biſhops themſelues were iudged by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. Therefore when there were any biſhops to bee ordained for churches, it was decreed, that they ſhould aſſemble at the ſame church, withall (if it might without hurte of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) if not with ſome, at the leaſt two or three of the biſhops of their owne prouince, which (if he were not alreadie elected) ſhould guide and gouerne in the election of the biſhop, and the election being done ſhould examine it, and inquire of the man elected moſt ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and make due proofe of his whole life, and of his skill and abllitie to performe the office and duetie of a biſhopp. And then at laſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21305:190"/>ſhould inueſt him in his biſhops function. All which thinges were inſtituted and ſerued to this end, that there might be as much know ledge and mutuall care betweene churches &amp; the miniſters thereof, as could be poſſible: both for the remoouing &amp; expelling of all ſcandalls of doctrine and life, and alſo to the earneſtes and more effectuall maintaining, prouoking &amp; encreaſing of the edification of faith, &amp; a life worthie of Chriſt our Lord. In ſo much as if any one did loyter or neglect their owne duetie, the other biſhops might be readie to help, yea euen ſo farre forth as to the ſuſpending of the obſtinate, and vtter caſting them out of their biſhops function. Wee ſhould conſider what Saint Cyprian writeth to Stephan the romaine biſhop, concerning Martian biſhop of Arela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis: who fell into the ſect of Nouatian, booke 2. Epiſt. 13, and which he writt in his 3. epiſtle and firſt booke, <hi>Of a certaine flock diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto euerie one of the ſhepheards,</hi> and which hee ſpake in the councell of Carthage, as hee writt to Quirinus.</p>
               <p>Nowe further when the world beganne to be full of churches, &amp; that the Metropolitanes had alſo neede of their peculiar care: (for not all, there beginning now to grow very many, had other skil inough or watchfulnes inough for their place: for euer and in all orders of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be few that doe excell) the care of ſome prouinces was committed to certen biſhops of the chiefe churches, as to the biſhop of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21305:190"/>Rome, of Conſtantinople, of Antioch and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, and afterwards of Caeſarea, &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, and certaine others, as by reaſon of the great encreaſe of churches of the faithful, neceſſitie did require. But notwithſtanding, theſe primate biſhops, (whom afterward they called Patriarches) had no authoritie ouer the other biſhops or churches, more then (as I ſaid before) the Metropolitaines had ouer the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and churches of their prouinces. Euerie one did owe a ſpeciall care and diligence to that portion of the churches that belonged to him: it was his duetie alſo to admoniſh the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in time if any had offended, or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his duetie: and if admonition preuailed not, then to add the authoritie of a counſell. Among theſe the firſt place was giuen to him of Rome: both for the reuerence of S. Peter, and alſo for the maieſtie of the cittie. Which reaſon the fathers afterward following, gaue the ſecond place to him of Conſtantinople, as being a ſecond Rome, and the biſhop of the emperiall ſea: whereas Antioch before, had obtained the ſecond place among theſe patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches.</p>
               <p>But as the nature of man depraued by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did euer labour more, that his rule might ſtretch farre, then to gouerne well: theſe patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, by occaſion of this generall care of the churches committed vnto them, drewe vnto themſelues, firſt the ordaining of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour biſhops: and by that ordaining, they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21305:191"/>crept by little and little and at laſt confirmed a iurisdiction ouer ſuch biſhopps, and their churches: which miſchiefe when it grew to bee verie great, there beganne a grieuous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a vniuerſall rule ouer all churches: which the firſt that laboured to get vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, was one Iohn biſhop of Conſtantinople, vnder the emperour Mauricius: concerning which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there are extant many epiſtles, among the epiſtles of S. Greg. booke 5.6.7.10.</p>
               <p>At length vnder Phocas, hee of Rome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this title of <hi>vniuerſall biſhop,</hi> which the biſhops of that ſea beganne more and more by degrees to abuſe: euen vntill by occaſion, firſt by diuiſion of the Empire vnder Charles the great, afterwardes by diſſentions of princes and nations, whereby they tore and rent the power of the emperors of the Weſt, and other kinges: they exalted themſelues into that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian power which nowe they bragg of: hauing oppreſſed the powers, firſt of biſhops, and then of all kinges and emperors. Thus therefore hath Sathan ouerthrowne the hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome obedience and gouernment of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie orders: For the romaine Antichriſt got to himſelfe an immediate rule ouer all both cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and laitie: &amp; hath diſſolued &amp; broken the care and charge of biſhops, ſuch as were good biſhops, ouer thoſe that were committed to their truſt. But ſeing it muſt needs be, that all orders of clerks muſt haue their gouernors &amp; ouerſeers, therefore the power of biſhops
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21305:191"/>muſt be reſtored, as alſo of Archdeacons, and al others, by what name ſoeuer they be called, to whome anie portion of gouerning and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the clergie, is committed: and alſo a watchfullnes and inquirie that there be none in this order vngarded or vnlooked vnto. Thus farre Bucer, not onely rehearſing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commending the cuſtome of the auncient church, ordaining diuers orders of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functions, whereof we before ſpake.</p>
               <p>I ſhould alſo haue had conſideration of thoſe churches, which albeit they imbrace the goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus: yet they ſtill retaine their biſſiops and Archbiſhops both in deed and name.</p>
               <p>What? that in the churches euen of the proteſtants, neither biſhops indeed nor arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops are wanting: whome, hauing turned the names out of good greeke, into badd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, they call Superintendents, and generall Superintendents? yea there alſo, where neither thoſe old names in good greeke, nor theſe newe in ill latine, are vſed at all: yet there are wont to bee ſome ſuperior perſons, in whoſe hands is almoſt the whole authoritie. The controuerſie then hath beene about the names: but ſeing wee agree about the thing, why ſhould wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend about the names? By the way, as I did not diſallow the Fathers, in that matter, whereuppon the queſtion is: ſo can I not but loue the zeale of our men, which do therefore hate thoſe names, becauſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21305:192"/>they are afraide, leaſt with the names, the old ambition and tirannie ſhould bee brought in againe, to the deſtruction of the church.</p>

               <p>For neither did Chriſt ordaine any ſuch head: neither would the fathers admit therof, becauſe it was not expedient for the church: but contented themſelues with the foure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches of Rome, Conſtantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, all which, were of an equall authoritie and power: and euery of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined within his owne bounds: as alſo it was decreed in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at Nice, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers: &amp; that not without many &amp; very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cauſes: whereof, in my iudgement, this was not one of the leaſt, leaſt there ſhould bee a doore ſet open to tirannie in the church: but rather if that any one durſt attempt any thing, againſt the ſound doctrin of Chriſt, &amp; againſt the libertie of the church: then the other arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops with their biſhops, of no leſſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, might oppoſe themſelues againſt him, &amp; ſuppreſſe his inſolencie and cut of his tiranny.

            <head>An appendix to the eleuenth chap. Of Chriſt the redeemer or of the perſon of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THey which write that the eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of the diuine nature, are reallie communicated to the humaine nature, not that they be in the ſame, either eſſentiallie and formally, or ſubiectiuelie and habitually, but onely by the reaſon, and reſpect of the perſonall or Hypoſtaticall vnion (for ſo they ſpeake, darkelie indeede and ambiguouſlie, when both they might and ought to ſpeake plainer:) if they meane this in no other ſenſe, then as Vigilius writ and thought: namely, that the proprieties of the natures, are made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Chriſt himſelfe, but are common to the natures betwixt themſelues, not in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but in Chriſt, that is, in his perſon: I will not ſurelie, gaineſay them, neither do I thinke that any good or learned man will gaineſay them. For Vigilius according to the catholick chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doctrine, ſpeaking out of the councell at Calcedon, ſaid and declared, that the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the humaine nature were made commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the diuine, in the verie ſame ſenſe, that the diuine are alſo ſaide to bee communicated to the humaine. But now theſe proprieties of the humanitie, as to ſuffer, or to die, are ſo commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the deitie, that for all that, yet the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21305:193"/>verie deitie is not made in verie deede, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or mortall: the cauſe whereof, Vigilius ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe to be this: namelie, becauſe <hi>to die</hi> and <hi>to ſuffer,</hi> are not made common to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie but onely in the perſon: ſo that they can not truely be ſaid, but of the humaine nature by it ſelfe, and of the perſon, in reſpect of the humaine nature.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt euen ſo thinke and ſaye altogether of the communication of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine proprieties. Vigilius owne wordes bee theſe booke 5. chap. 2.</p>
            <p>And now ſith out intention is chiefly bent againſt thoſe which following the error of one nature, doe with a willfull obſtinacie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the decree of the Calcedon councell. I thinke it not amiſſe, for the remoouing of their vaine contradictions, and beating to peeces their glaſſie opinions with the mallett of truth, to rehearſe ſome fewe things, concerning the humaine nature of the ſonne of God, which they euerie waye denie to be in him: and to ſhew what want of chriſtianity is in them, and how farre of they bee from the hope of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. It is a rule of the catholick faith, to confeſſe, one and the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as true God, ſo alſo true man: one of them both, &amp; not two into one: the ſame without all time borne of the father, the ſame in time borne of the virgine: ſo that each of theſe births do ſo hold on Chriſt, that he ſuffred not any loſſe in
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21305:194"/>either: retaining in himſelf that was proper to him both waies, that is, that the nature of the word ſhould not be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in the fleſh, &amp; the nature of the fleſh was not ſwallowed vpp in the word. Hereuppon the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt, is true God, and the ſame, true man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting vnſpeakably of two natures, vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one perſon in the virgines wombe: which natures, ſeing that in this wonderfull covnion they are not aboliſhed in him: to ſhew a plaine extance and appearance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of them both in himſelfe being one, he did and ſpake thinges, belonging to both: not deuiding the wordes, nor parting the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, nor ſeperating his deeds: but he himſelf being one, ſpeaking and doing in himſelf and by both, that which was agreeable, and was proper to both natures. And to make it more plaine which we haue ſaid, let vs vſe an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as thus, I my ſelfe am hee, which with my bodilie eyes doe behold a white colour or a blacke: and againe I am hee, which by ſight of my minde doe iudge of the euill of iniquitie, and the good of righteouſneſſe: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I am not now diuers perſons, becauſe I doe both theſe in a diuerſe reſpect. For I doe not ſee the difference of coulours, with the ſame eyes, with which I ſee the diuerſitie of ſpeaches: and yet I am the verie ſame, which doe this both the wayes: both are in me not to ſee righteouſneſſe but onely with the eyes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21305:194"/>of my minde, and it is in me not to ſee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but onely with the eyes of my fleſh: and it is in me not to heare wordes with my eyes, and in me not to ſee light with my eares: in me not to iudge of taſtes with my noſe, and in me not to perceiue ſmelling at my mouth. And whereas it is wholly mine owne proprietie in my ſelfe, to ſee, to heare, to ſmel, to taſte: and yet it is one thing in me whereby I ſee, another whereby I heare, another wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I taſte or ſmell: and all this being in me wholly, and yet in a certaine priuate reſpect deuided and diuers: I my ſelfe notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding cannot be deuided or ſeperated: So therefore Chriſt himſelfe alſo, being one and the ſame, created, and not created; hauing beginning, &amp; being without beginning: growing in age &amp; vnderſtanding, and receiuing no increaſe of age and vnderſtanding: ſuffering death, &amp; not yeelding to the lawes of death: receiuing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for his deſert, yet hauing need of no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s honor: and al theſe things being diuers in him, yet are meerely proper vnto himſelfe: And therfore he diuideth not in himſelf, the words, affects, and deedes, agreeable both wayes in himſelfe: becauſe both are properly his owne: yet hauing one proprietie by the nature of <hi>the word,</hi> which remaining God, he loſt not: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by the nature of the fleſh, which, being made man, hee receiued. Wee will yet ſpeake more, to confirme more plainely this one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for their ſakes which through their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21305:195"/>skilfullneſſe, not vnderſtanding the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and communion of the natures, howe it is ſaid to be in Chriſt, do abuſe and vtterly refuſe the ſame words.</p>
            <p>It is diuerſe and another thing, not to haue beginning, and to ſubſiſt by a beginning: to die, and not to bee able to ſuffer: yet, as they are both proper vnto Chriſt, ſo are they both common, not vnto him, but in him. For if wee ſay, <hi>common vnto him:</hi> we muſt needs bee vrged and driuen, to giue and ſhew ſome other, with whom the ſame ſhould be common vnto him: which neceſſity of inſtance, cannot but incline to the impious opinion of Neſtorius. We ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better and more catholically: ſaye, <hi>it is common in him</hi> and not to him: and ſo wee ſay better, <hi>it is proper to him, and not in him.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is proper to him to dye, by the nature of his fleſh, which is mortall: and it is proper to him, not to dye, by the nature of <hi>the vvord,</hi> which cannot dye. Likewiſe by that vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable miſterie of the vnion of both the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the mortallitie of the fleſh was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in him, to the nature of the <hi>vvord,</hi> which could not dye: and the immortalitie of the <hi>vvorde</hi> was common in him, to the nature of the fleſh, which yeelded to death. Therefore as it is proper vnto him in reſpect of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to dye and not to dye: ſo it is common in him, in both natures, to doe that which is their proprietie: and as I maye (for example ſake) ſay, it is proper to me, to carry the marke
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21305:195"/>of the blackneſſe of a ſtroakein my bodie, by the nature of my fleſh: ſo it is proper to me to carrie the ſtripe of a word, that is, of ſome hard ſpeach, in my minde, by the nature of my ſoule: and it is alſo proper to me, not to carrie the ſame ſtripe of wordes in my bodie by the nature of my fleſh. And ſith both theſe are proper to me: and both of them different from my bodie and from my ſoule: becauſe neither my bodie vnderſtandeth anie hard or any pleaſing ſpeaches, neither can my ſoule be made blacke by the ſtroake of a whipp: yet both theſe are common in my ſelfe, both to my ſoule and to my body: becauſe, neither my ſoule placed out of my bodie, doth feele that, which is proper to it to feele: nor my bodie without the companie of my ſoule, can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the marks of the blowes. That therefore, which is proper vnto me in either of them and yer different from neither of them; that is common in my whole ſelfe to either of them, which is proper to either of them.</p>
            <p>And yet I am the verie ſame in them both, being both of them common in me: and I am the very ſame in either of them, being both proper to me. This ſaith Vigilius.</p>
            <p>What can more fittly be ſaid for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this preſent controuerſie, of the reall communication of the proprieties? For this whole treatiſe of Vigilius is reſolued into theſe ſpeciall propoſitions, pertaining to our cauſe. For ſetting firſt downe a rule of the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21305:196"/>catholicke faith, which in the text is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letter A: then from the ſame hee draweth certaine poſitions, by which he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly confuteth the hereſie of Eutyches. The ſumme of that rule of faith, is this: that one and the ſame Chriſt, is God and man: &amp; both natures are kept whole in him. Out of this rule Vigilius gathered theſe poſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Lord Ieſus Chriſt, is the ſame true God: and the ſame true man. The reaſon: for he exiſteth of two natures, (the diuine and the humaine) vnſpeakablie ioyned and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in one perſon, and that in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins wombe. This is againſt Neſtorius; againſt Eutyches, is added another poſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Theſe natures in that wonderfull cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, are not aboliſhed in Chriſt. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation followeth by the life of Chriſt: becauſe the Lord Ieſus both by his ſayings and deeds did ſhew that the proprieties of both the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, remained ſafe and whole in him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To ſhe we an extancie (that is, an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence) of the proprieties of them both in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being one: namely: that the proprieties of both the natures did exiſt diſtinct in him: he ſpake and did things of both natures himſelfe being one. This is alſo againſt Eutyches.</p>
            <p>But how? namely ſo, that he ſhewed, howe theſe ſayings and deeds, were not the actions of two perſons, but of one. Therefore againſt Neſtorius he alſo addeth: <hi>Not in making a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21305:196"/>in vvords, or ſhewing ſundrie aſpects, or ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deedes: but hee himſelfe being one, ſpeaking and doing in himſelfe and by both (that is by both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) that vvhich was agreeable and vvas proper to both the natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe words we may perceiue theſe two thinges as cleare as the noone day: one that there were not in Chriſt, two which did worke and will, &amp; vnderſtand, but onely one: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very worde incarnate, which is called Chriſt: therefore he ſaith <hi>in himſelfe being one &amp;c.</hi> Alſo, <hi>hee himſelfe being one ſpeaking and doing in himſelfe:</hi> this is the firſt, and that againſt Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</p>
            <p>The other is. That yet there were and are in Chriſt working, two beginnings of actions, diſtinct in themſelues: by which thoſe actions (as the ſchoolemen ſaye) were formallie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the agent: namely the faculties or powers of the two natures: and this is againſt Eutyches.</p>
            <p>And therefore hee ioyneth: <hi>by both</hi> (that is, by both natures) <hi>ſpeaking and doing, that which is proper, to both natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe who ſeeth not, that the the thinges which Chriſt did according to one nature: the ſame he did not according to the other? For he did by both, ſuch thinges as were proper to each: he did not therefore according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, ſuch things as belonged to his deitie: nor contrary wiſe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and ſet forth the ſame
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21305:197"/>he bringeth in an example of one &amp; the ſame man, who according to the diuers faculties of the ſoule, doth worke diuers actions, and bringeth foorth deedes agreeable to each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</p>
            <p>The example appeareth of it ſelfe, there: <hi>And to make it more plaine, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we muſt warily marke his particles, not onely the affirmatiues, but alſo the negatiues. For he denies that a man ſees thoſe thinges with the eyes of his fleſh, which he ſeeth with the eyes of his minde: and contrariwiſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee alſo denies that Chriſt doeth thoſe things according to his fleſh: which he worketh according to his deitie. This he plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, whenas applying the example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other thinges he ſaieth of Chriſt, <hi>But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one propertie by the nature of the word, vvhich remaining God, he loſt not: and another by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fleſh, vvhich being made man, hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo to bee marked, that Vigilius, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well denieth that Chriſt doeth by the fleſh, that is, according to the fleſh, thoſe thinges, which are proper to the deitie: as hee deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that hee ſuffred &amp; did thoſe things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deitie, which were proper to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Vigilius alſo adioyneth a ſpeciall declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proprietie and communion of the natures, and the ſame verie perſpicuous &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: where he ſaieth, <hi>We vill yet ſpeake more to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:21305:197"/>confirme this nature for their ſakes, &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme is this:</p>
            <p n="4">4 The proprieties of both the natures are proper to the verie perſon of Chriſt: but are common to the natures betwixt themſelues, not in the verie natures but in the perſon. The declaration is this.</p>
            <p>For to die (which is the proprietie of the fleſh) is proper to Chriſt. For in that hee is ſaide to haue died: it is properlie ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in reſpect of the humaine nature which is in him. Alſo, not to die is proper to him in reſpect of his diuine nature, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not die.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe to die, is common to <hi>the vvorde</hi> or deitie of Chriſt: not in the diuine nature it ſelfe, which cannot be partaker of death: but this was common to him with his fleſh in the perſon, becauſe the perſon which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the fleſh could dye in the fleſh, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did dye. The ſame is to be thought &amp; ſaid of the other part: as Vigilius alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: adding the example of himſelfe, that is, of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: where he ſaith, <hi>And for example ſake, to ſay, &amp;c.</hi> In this example there is nothing but that which is plaine.</p>
            <p>But the concluſion is diligentlie to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, where he ſaith: <hi>That therefore which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to me in either of them, and yet different from either of them: the ſame is common in me to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, vvhich is proper to either of them. And yet I am the verie ſame one in them both, being both of them common in mee: and I am
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21305:198"/>the verie ſame in either of them, being both proper to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing can be ſaid more cleare for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the queſtion concerning the reall communication of the proprieties. For firſt he teacheth, that the proprieties of the one nature are ſo proper vnto it ſelfe, that they are quite different from the other nature, and ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that in their proper eſſence they can by no meanes be made common: that is, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſo really communicated, that the ſame ſhould be made that verie ſame, or the like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other nature: as, for example, that the humanitie ſhould bee made the deitie, or bee made omnipotent, or, on the contrarie, that the deitie could be made the humanitie, or be made partaker of paſſion or ſuffring.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He deliuereth in plaine tearms, that the proprieties of each nature, are proper vnto Chriſt: becauſe indeed, it is proper vnto him in himſelfe (for example) in one nature to ſuffer, and in his other not to bee able to ſuffer: ſo as this he hath common with no other thing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, or on earth, or in himſelfe. For there is nothing beſides himſelfe, that is both God and man: and neither of the natures in him, hath alſo the proprieties of the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beſids their owne, in their proper eſſence. Therefore it belongeth onely to Chriſt God and man, to haue in himſelfe really, &amp; therefore proper to himſelfe, the eſſential proprieties of each nature, both diuine and humaine.</p>
            <pb n="361" facs="tcp:21305:198"/>
            <p>Wherefore hereby is it manifeſt alſo, which before was ſaid of the communication. For if this bee proper to the perſon of Chriſt, that theſe contraries, namely, to ſuffer, and not to be able to ſuffer, may truely and indeede bee ſaid of him, and yet not ſimplie, but in reſpect of ſome other thing, that is in reſpect of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature: Then can it not agree to anie of both his natures ſeuerally, that the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould truely and really be ſaid, to be able to ſuffer and not to ſuffer, in it owne proper eſſence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The proprieties of the natures which he ſaid were proper to Chriſt: theſe hee taught to be made common in themſelues, not indeed in the very natures themſelues, but in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For example: <hi>To ſuſſer</hi> which is proper to the humaine nature ſimplie and by it ſelfe in it owne eſſence, but proper to the perſon in reſpect of ſome other thing that is, onely in reſpect of the fleſh: I ſay this eſſentiall propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of the fleſh, by reaſon of the vnion, which the fleſh hath with the deity it ſelfe in the ſame perſon, is made alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the verie diuine nature it ſelfe with the humaine: how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon? namely that <hi>to ſuſſer</hi> is truely attributed alſo to the diuine nature.</p>
            <p>But how can that be, ſith paſſion cannot fal into it? It is therefore common to it <hi>to ſuffer,</hi> not in the owne eſſence (for that nether could nor can ſuffer) but in Chriſt, that is, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, which conſiſteth of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21305:199"/>and therefore, which onely according to the fleſh ſuffred: ſo that in the proper eſſence of the deitie thereis no paſſion, but it is onely in the common perſon by reaſon of the fleſh: and conſequently God is alſo ſaid to haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when notwithſtanding the deitie ſuffred nothing, but onely the perſon of god &amp; man, that is he which is God and man, ſuffred <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh.</hi> I will rehearſe this againe. The proprieties (for example) of the humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>to ſuffer,</hi> &amp; <hi>to die,</hi> they are therefore ſaid to be common to the deitie, becauſe the deitie alſo hath them. For if in no ſort it had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the ſame could be ſaid no wayes to be made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to it with the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Now then, they are truely ſaid to be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the deitie with the humanitie, not ſimplie, but in Chriſt: becauſe it hath them not in it ſelfe, that is, in the owne eſſence, as the fleſh hath: but onely in the perſon of Chriſt, which is one and the ſame perſon of both the natures, ſeing it ſubſiſteth in both of them.</p>
            <p>The ſoule alſo hath the proprieties of the body, common vnto it ſelfe, not in it owne eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as the bodie: but in the perſon of man, who as he conſiſteth of them both, as being his eſſentiall partes, ſo alſo he hath in himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the proprieties of them both: ſo as he may truely be ſaid to be viſible, and inuiſible: mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and immortall.</p>
            <p>This which is ſaid of the proprieties of the humaine nature, common with the diuine, not
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21305:199"/>in the proper eſſence of it, but in the common perſon of both the natures; that the ſame alſo is to be thought and ſaide of the diuine proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the humaine, we are taught by Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us biſhop and martyr.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being in very deed thus, it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is to bee gathered, what manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be thought agreeable to theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. If a propriety of the fleſh, as <hi>to ſuffer,</hi> be in ſome ſort common to the deitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it may in ſome ſort be ſaid of the deitie. If it bee not in ſuch wiſe common to the ſame, as to haue it in it ſelfe, as in it owne eſſence, nor as an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parte of it ſelfe, nor as an accident in the ſubiect: then the deitie cannot bee ſaid, in it owne eſſence, to bee ſubiect to paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But if it bee common vnto it onely in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: then <hi>to ſuffer</hi> cannot be ſaid of the deitie in the abſtract, but onely in the Concrete: this is, by ſuch a worde, wherein the deitie maye bee ſo ſignified, as the perſon may bee ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it: ſuch as bee the Concrete names as God.</p>
            <p>For by this name, ſo farre forth as therein is ſignified, the perſon of Chriſt, which is alſo God, and not bare man, it is truely and really ſaid that God did ſuffer, and died: yet not fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, and according to his deitie alſo, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the fleſh: whoſe propertie it is to ſuffer and to dye. Wherefore as this is moſt true, God ſuffered: ſo this is moſt
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:21305:200"/>falſe, the deitie ſuffred: or that Chriſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diuine nature ſuffred. This is the doctrine of Vigilius, and the whole church.</p>
            <p>But ſeing, that which Vigilius hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of the proprieties and communion of the natures, is indifferently ſaid of all the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and their communion in Chriſt: ſo that by this hypoſtaticall or perſonall vnion, the diuine proprieties are ſaid to be made commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the humanitie in the ſame ſenſe, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine are to the diuinitie: namely not in the eſſences of the natures themſelues, but onely in Chriſt and in the perſon of Chriſt: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, like as the propoſition is impious, <hi>the deny, by reaſon of the vnion with the fleſh in the perſon of the ſonce of god, is made partaker of paſſion in it owne eſſence:</hi> ſo alſo this is blaſphemous: <hi>the humaine nature, by reaſon of the vnion with the diuine, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of it, that it is omnipotent really, in it ovvne eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we add that, which the ſame Vigili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us left in writing out of the common conſent of the whole church booke 4. chap. 4. this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which we ſhewed eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now out of him, will more plainely appeare. For diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Monophyſites (defenders of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) he plainely prooueth, by the diuers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, which were ſeene in one &amp; the ſame Chriſt, and which the holy Scriptures do ſpeak of, that <hi>the word</hi> and <hi>the fleſh</hi> cannot bee in him all one nature: he bringeth a reaſon, becauſe one nature cannot receiue in it ſelfe any thing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21305:200"/>that is contrary &amp; diuers: beſides other things he alſo writeth thus: Moreouer if there be but one nature of <hi>the word</hi> and <hi>of the fleſh,</hi> how can it be but that <hi>the worde</hi> being in all places, the fleſh muſt be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in al places too? For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe when it was on earth, then was it not in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; now being in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is not likewiſe on earth: yea it is ſo farre from being on earth, as that according to it, we looke for Chriſt to come downe from heauen, whome according to <hi>the word</hi> we beleeue to bee with vs on earth. Therefore according to your opinions: either <hi>the word</hi> with his fleſh is contained within one place: or the fleſh with <hi>the word</hi> is in all places: whereas one nature cannot receiue in it ſelfe any contrarie or diuers things. But it is verie contrarie and farre different, to be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or contained in one place, and, to be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where: and ſeing <hi>the word</hi> is euerie where, and the fleſh is not euerie where: it appeareth that one &amp; the ſame Chriſt is of both natures: and that he is euerie where, according to the nature of his diuinitie, and is contained in a place, according to the nature of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: that he hath beene created, and hath no beginning: that he hath died, and hath not bin able to dye: the one he hath by the nature of <hi>the word,</hi> whereby he is God: the other by the nature of the fleſh, whereby the ſame God is man. Wherefore, this one the ſonne of God, &amp; the ſame made the ſonne of man, hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by the nature of his fleſh, and hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21305:201"/>by the nature of his diuinitie: he was created, by the nature of his fleſh, and was not created, by the nature of his diuinitie: hee is circumſcribed, by the nature of his fleſh, and is not contained within place, by the nature of his diuinity: he is leſſe alſo then the angels, by the nature of his fleſh, and is equall to the father, according to the nature of his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: he died, by nature of his fleſh, &amp; died not, by nature of his diuinitie. This is the catholick faith and confeſſion, which the Apoſtles deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the Martyrs confirmed, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full do yet aſſuredly hold. Thus ſaith Vigilius.</p>
            <p>By this the very ſame is vndoubtedly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which was alſo by the other before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not onely that the <hi>worde</hi> and fleſh, cannot poſſiblie be both of one nature, as the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſites affirmed: but alſo that the proprieties of the one nature, cannot really be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the other: ſo as indeed, it ſhould haue the ſame in it ſelfe, and that the one nature ſhould be made the very like, that the other is: as thus, that the fleſh, by reaſon of the vnion with the <hi>word,</hi> ſhould alſo with the ſame <hi>word,</hi> bee made preſent in all places, in it owne eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuce. For from this propoſition, which is held for graunted, of all ſound beleeuers, namely, <hi>The fleſh through the vnion with the word, hath not gotten this proprietie of the word, that it ſelfe, ſhould with the word be preſent in all places, in it owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> from this propoſition (I ſay) he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, therefore neither is it made of the ſame
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21305:201"/>nature with the <hi>word.</hi> This certenly is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Vigilius, yea of the whole catholicke church. What remaineth? onely this, that if it may be ſaid to bee preſent in all places: it can be ſaid to bee ſo, by no other meanes, then by the Hypoſtaſie of it, which is the very <hi>word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in Chriſts humaine nature, there be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two things: the proper eſſence of his nature, with his proprieties and gifts created: and the common Hypoſtaſis with the diuine, which is <hi>the word</hi> it ſelfe. His proper eſſence is finite or determinate, and ſo is onely within one place: The Hypoſtaſis is infinite, immeaſurable, and moſt ſimple or vnmixt. And therefore in this onely, and not in the proper eſſence, the fleſh of Chriſt can be, and in verie deed is, preſent in all places.</p>
            <p>That which hath bin ſaid of this propriety: the ſame is alſo to be thought of all the reſt, aſwell thoſe of the <hi>word,</hi> as of the fleſh. For alſo in the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before going, againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophyſites, book 4. chap. 4. he concludeth the ſame, from certaine proprieties of the <hi>word,</hi> as is, to be vncreated, inuiſible, vntouchable: &amp; ſaid, that it is impoſſible, the fleſh ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in thoſe qualities. Hereuppon he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore, the fleſh cannot bee of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the <hi>word:</hi> ſith it can by no meanes be made, inuiſible, vncreated, vntouchable: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this in it owne eſſence: whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in the Hypoſtaſis of it, which is common to it with the <hi>vvorde,</hi> it is in verie
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:21305:202"/>deed, as in all places preſent, ſo alſo, vncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, inuiſible, vntouchable, and what not? ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame Hypoſtaſis it is alſo god. Theſe things are all moſt aſſured and plaine, and do depend vpon that infallible rule, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the fift booke and ſecond chapter: namely, <hi>We ſaye better and more catholically: it is common in him, and not vnto him:</hi> And we ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>it is proper to him, and not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech all chriſtians, by our Lord Ieſus, that ſetting aſide all the vaine dreames of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men: and reiecting all the affections, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, enmities of their fleſh: and imbracing, the aſſured and wholeſome doctrine of the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
